## Course Completion Criteria

The Vinternship program follows a structured learning path with clear milestones to track your progress. Successful completion of the internship requires fulfilling all three mandatory components:

**1. ViBe Training (Core Learning) -** Complete all training modules on the ViBe platform covering TypeScript, React, Express.js, and MongoDB. This phase builds strong fundamentals before moving to advanced topics.

**2. Case Studies (Advanced Learning) -** Work through case studies based on real-world problems across different areas of the stack. These reinforce understanding through practical application and help you think through design decisions and trade-offs.

**3. Projects (Practical Learning) -** Build projects that demonstrate your ability to work across the entire stack. Projects reflect real-world applications and serve as portfolio-worthy demonstrations of your skills.
