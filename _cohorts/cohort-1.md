## 📋 General Information

Welcome to VLED Connect!

This cohort is designed for interns joining through the VLED Connect initiative. Multiple colleges have partnered with VLED to provide their students with this opportunity to enroll in the MERN course.

**Programme Overview**  
This internship programme is delivered through an AI-enabled learning platform with strict proctoring and progress verification. The internship consists of three phases. Learning is case-based and led by industry practitioners rather than traditional lecture formats. The programme focuses on the MERN stack, with key areas including TypeScript, React, MongoDB, and Express, forming a comprehensive full-stack development pathway. The duration of the internship is two months and may be extended up to two and a half months in certain special cases.

**Selection and Completion Safeguards**   
Student selection will be institution-led, with faculty nominations preferred. Institutions are encouraged to implement strict selection criteria and a structured evaluation process to ensure proper performance and reduce dropouts. Faculty members and interns in this cohort can access their college-wise dashboards for real-time updates. The dashboard link is available in the section below.


### Important Notes:
- All interns are managed by their respective College SPOCs.
