My First Internship Experience: A Journey of Learning, Confidence, and Growth

This internship holds a very special place in my journey because it is my first internship, and I began it with a lot of excitement, happiness, and energy. At the start, I was highly motivated and eager to explore what this opportunity had to offer, and even now, I continue with the same enthusiasm.

Initially, I was unsure about what a virtual internship would be like. I had many questions and very little clarity. However, the moment I entered the program, things began to change. The stand-up sessions conducted by the team played a crucial role in building my confidence. Their valuable words, encouragement, and guidance motivated me and made me believe in myself.

During the internship, I started learning the MERN stack using the Vibe platform. At first, I wondered whether learning through short videos would actually be effective. But honestly, it worked really well. Watching 1–2 minute concept-focused videos followed by quizzes helped me understand and memorize concepts easily. This learning method made complex topics feel simple and engaging.

While progressing through the course, I observed something interesting. The topics I studied recently stayed fresh in my memory, but recalling the initial topics felt a bit difficult. This made me question my learning process. However, everything became clear when I started working on case studies. They helped me realize the true meaning of the quote:

“Practice makes a person perfect.”

No matter how many videos we watch or how many hours we spend learning, real understanding comes only through practice. The case studies were designed in such a way that all the required theory and concepts were provided within the platform itself. This allowed me to revise topics quickly and apply my knowledge confidently without referring to external resources.

Another major source of motivation was the seniors from previous cohorts. Their guidance and encouragement boosted my confidence and inspired me to stay consistent. Although I couldn’t participate in many breakout sessions, the few sessions I attended were truly memorable. Interacting with people from different states and diverse backgrounds was a great experience and broadened my perspective.

In the end, this internship was not just about learning technical skills. It helped me grow personally by improving my confidence, discipline, and problem-solving mindset. This experience made me feel more capable and prepared for future opportunities.

I am truly grateful for this internship and also to Sudarshan Iyengar sir, VLED Labs as it has made me feel special, confident, and motivated to continue learning and improving myself
