This Vinternship at the VLED Lab helped me on how I actually learn. From the beginning, with ViBe course and case studies helped me a lot to understand from the scratch. With Standup meetings and live session it was engaging interaction with peers. 

And the ViBe platform with AI procotoring was bit difficult to complete but it was also really interactive as there were quiz after each video and concepts made simpler for better understanding. With case studies it was practical hands experience on coding.

More than technical exposure, this Vinternship gave me confidence to be honest about my learning process, to reflect deeply, and to grow step by step. This is a lesson I will carry forward beyond this internship.

I am grateful for this opportunity and thanks to
