## 📌 Vlog Overview

In this vlog, I walk through the practical implementation of core HTTP methods — **GET, POST, and DELETE** — by explaining the backend code used during my Vinternship journey.

Instead of theoretical explanations, this video focuses purely on a code walkthrough and understanding how APIs work in a real project environment.

### 🚀 What You Will Learn

- How **GET** requests retrieve data from the server  
- How **POST** requests send and store new data  
- How **DELETE** requests remove data from the database  
- How frontend and backend communicate using REST APIs  
- Practical understanding of API routes and server-side logic  

This vlog reflects my authentic learning experience by explaining the code step-by-step.
