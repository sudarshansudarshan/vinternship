This is actually my first time doing something completely out of my curriculum, and honestly, I didn’t have any prior experience with full stack development before this internship. So right from the beginning, I knew that I had to first learn the topic properly, get a hold of it within the given deadline, and then implement it in such a way that I would never ever forget it.

At first, I genuinely felt that completing such a course in just 4 weeks would be difficult. Adding to that, the platform mainly consisted of video-based learning, which initially didn’t make me feel like I was actually learning something. Because of that, I was a bit worried—whether I would be able to complete the tasks on time and whether I was really understanding the concepts or not.

But after listening to a couple of videos, things slowly started to make sense. I found myself understanding the topics better and was even able to answer questions properly. After spending many hours listening and revisiting the content, I was honestly moved by this whole concept of learning. It wasn’t rushed, and it pushed me to think rather than just follow steps. Along with this, I also started working on case studies in parallel, which helped me connect the concepts to real scenarios.

One small issue—or I’d say a minor irritation—was that the platform lagged at times, especially in the beginning. Due to some issues on my side, I had to rewatch a few videos, which made me focus more on how to listen rather than actually listening to the topic itself. But over time, even that became manageable.

Overall, I’ve had a really good experience so far. This internship gave me exposure to something completely new and helped me develop a different way of learning. I’m looking forward to the future events and opportunities ahead, hoping they bring more energy and eventually help me grow into a confident and professional full stack developer.
