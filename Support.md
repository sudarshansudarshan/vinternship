The Pinternship programme follows a structured support and grievance redressal mechanism to ensure clarity, accountability, and timely resolution of participant queries. All students are required to follow the prescribed support flow in sequence before escalating any issue.

The **Broadcast Channel** is the official communication channel of the Pinternship programme. All programme-related announcements, instructions, timelines, and policy updates shall be communicated exclusively through this channel.

This channel operates on a one-way communication model, and participants are not permitted to post responses or raise queries. Students are expected to regularly monitor this channel and act in accordance with the information communicated.

The **Discussion Channel** is intended to facilitate student-student interaction and peer-supported problem solving. Participants may use this channel to seek clarifications, discuss academic or platform-related issues, and exchange ideas with fellow interns.

Students are expected to engage responsibly, maintain academic decorum, and review existing discussions before raising new queries.

The **Pinternship Support Desk** constitutes the formal support mechanism for all technical, administrative, and programme-related issues. Participants are required to raise a support ticket through the official support desk at  
**pinternship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in** when their issue cannot be resolved through official announcements or peer discussion.

Students must retain their ticket reference number and allow adequate time for resolution before proceeding further.

The **Escalation Channel** is a restricted support mechanism and shall be used strictly as a last resort. Participants may access this channel only when their query remains unresolved despite following all prior steps, including raising a formal support ticket with the Support Desk.

This channel is reserved for critical issues that materially affect participation or progression. Premature or inappropriate use of the escalation mechanism may result in delayed response.
