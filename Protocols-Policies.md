## Support and Resolution Protocol

<img src="../support-escalation.png" alt="Escalation Protocol" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">

The Vinternship programme follows a structured support and grievance redressal mechanism. If you have a query, please follow the steps below in order:

### 1. Discord Announcements
Start by checking the official **Discord Announcement Channel** for the latest announcements, instructions, and program updates. This channel serves as the primary communication hub where important information about deadlines, schedule changes, submission guidelines, and common clarifications are posted regularly. Often, the answer to your query has already been addressed in a recent announcement, saving you time and effort.

### 2. Ask Vi-Sakha
Utilize [Vi-Sakha](https://sakha.vicharanashala.ai/){:target="_blank"}, our intelligent AI assistant, for immediate support. Vi-Sakha is trained on the Vinternship program documentation and can provide instant answers to questions about course content, technical concepts, project requirements, platform navigation, and general program policies. This 24/7 available resource offers quick clarifications without waiting for human support.

### 3. FAQ/Breakout Discussions
Before escalating your query, explore two valuable peer-based resources:

- **Check the [FAQ Page](../faq/)**: Review our comprehensive FAQ section, which addresses common questions about the internship, deadlines, submission guidelines, evaluation criteria, and technical issues. Many common queries are already answered there.

- **Discuss in Breakout Rooms**: Engage with your fellow interns in the designated breakout discussions. Your peers may have encountered and resolved similar challenges. Collaborative problem-solving not only helps you find solutions faster but also strengthens the learning community.

<!-- ### 4. Support Desk
If your query remains unresolved, write to the Support Desk at **vinternship@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in**. Our support team will respond within **2 hours** of your submission (between 9 AM to 9 PM). Any question submitted beyond 9 PM will be answered the next day. Please ensure that the subject of the email follows the structure *"CohortName_NPTELID/FullName_YourEmailSubject"*.


If you do not receive a response within 24 hours, you may raise a second ticket with the subject line: *"Attention Please – Follow-up on Ticket #[Original Ticket Number]"*. This ticket will be escalated to our Mentors Team, who will assume responsibility for it. They will schedule a call discussion to ensure your issue is clearly understood and resolved directly.

If your concern remains unaddressed after 48 hours of your first ticket (and after raising a follow-up), you may escalate the matter via email to the Internship Sponsor. Please CC **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar** directly, along with your department’s faculty reference, your department HOD, and the VLED Team at `dled@iitrpr.ac.in`. Ensure that your email includes your full name, department, reference numbers and dates of the two Zoho Desk tickets, and a brief explanation of the unresolved issue. -->

To maintain consistency and ensure efficient support, we request all interns to strictly follow this three-step resolution path for all issues.

## Ejection Policy

### A Culture of Momentum: The Ejection Policy

<img src="../Ejection.png" alt="Ejection Policy" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">

To maintain a high-energy environment, the program prioritizes **sustained effort** and active engagement over passive participation. We believe a learning community thrives when every participant contributes to the collective "pulse," which is why we employ a dynamic **Ejection Policy** to ensure the cohort remains focused. This system recognizes two distinct paths of movement:

#### Forward Eject (The Ascent)
Super-performers who consistently stay at the top of the cohort and demonstrate **exceptional performance** are "ejected" upward into advanced leadership opportunities. These individuals may also be considered for prestigious **fellowship nominations** based on their demonstrated capability and reflective practice.

#### Backward Eject (The Departure)
To preserve the quality of the experience and focus resources on committed learners, participants who remain persistently idle are removed from the cohort. This ensures that collaborative activities, such as **peer-to-peer viva sessions**, are conducted among interns who are equally invested in their growth.

### The Progress Algorithm

We ensure transparency and fairness by using an automated, dual-criteria filter to identify idle participants. A **Backward Eject** is only triggered if an intern meets **both** of the following conditions simultaneously:

1. **Daily Progress:** Your completion rate on the ViBe platform falls below **3.33% per day**.

2. **Cohort Standing:** Your overall engagement level ranks within the **bottom 10% of the active cohort**.

By maintaining a pace above this threshold, you ensure your spot in the program remains secure while you build meaningful professional artifacts, including **case studies and reflective blogs**.


### Milestone-Based Backward Ejection

In addition to day-to-day progress monitoring, the program employs a **structured milestone checkpoint system** to ensure participants are meeting critical learning objectives at designated intervals. This approach recognizes that consistent velocity is important, but achieving **concrete deliverable milestones** is essential for program completion and professional readiness.

#### Why Milestone-Based Ejection?

The Vinternship program is designed around a carefully sequenced curriculum with interdependent components. Missing critical milestones creates a cascading effect that:
- Prevents meaningful participation in collaborative activities (vivas, peer reviews)
- Compromises the quality of learning phases
- Signals disengagement that cannot be remediated within the program timeline

Therefore, **milestone achievement serves as a non-negotiable measure of program alignment**, ensuring all active participants maintain the foundational knowledge required for cohort-wide activities.
