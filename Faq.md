---

## 6. Discontinuation Policy

**6.1 What is the expected pace of learning?**  
This is a self-paced program, but you are expected to maintain steady progress through all three required components: Core Learning (ViBe Training), Advanced Learning (Case Studies), and Practical Learning (Projects). You should work through the modules consistently to ensure continuous engagement and build momentum in your learning journey.

**6.2 What happens if I don't maintain regular progress?**  
If you remain inactive or fail to make reasonable progress over an extended period, we may discontinue your access to the program. The program has a 2-month duration with a possible 15-day extension based on individual circumstances. This policy helps ensure that active learners have the best support and resources.

**6.3 Can I appeal a discontinuation decision?**  
No. Discontinuation decisions are **final** and cannot be appealed.

**6.4 Can I rejoin the program after discontinuation?**  
No. Once discontinued, you cannot rejoin the current program. You would need to apply fresh for any future program offerings, subject to availability.

**6.5 How does the Discontinuation Policy differ from the Ejection Policy?**  
The Discontinuation Policy addresses prolonged inactivity at an administrative level, while the Ejection Policy (see Section 10) is a real-time, algorithm-based mechanism focused on maintaining cohort momentum and learning quality.

## 9. MERN Case Studies

**9.1 What are Case Studies?**  
Case studies are the **second required component** (Advanced Learning) of the Pinternship program. They are well-structured, documentation-based lessons designed to help you apply what you learned in ViBe training through **hands-on coding**. Each case study focuses on real-world problem-solving, collaborative thinking, and practical implementation to help you become more confident with the technologies covered.

Case studies are organized by technology, including:
- TypeScript Fundamentals
- React Development
- Express.js Backend
- MongoDB Database

Each case study includes:
- Clear problem statements
- Defined learning objectives
- Step-by-step explanations
- Practical coding tasks
- Best practices and recommended patterns

**9.2 Are Case Studies mandatory?**  
Yes. Case studies are a **required component** for completing the Pinternship program. All participants must complete the case studies after finishing ViBe training and before moving to the Projects phase.

**9.3 How do I get started with Case Studies?**  
After completing all ViBe videos:

1. Click the **Case Studies** link in the navigation bar at the top of the page.
2. Select a **technology** and then choose a **lesson**.
3. Read the entire documentation carefully to understand the concept and tasks to be performed.
4. Try to understand each case study first, then attempt to code a solution for it.
5. Open a code editor (for example, **VS Code**) and implement the tasks.
6. Getting stuck is normal - ask questions on Cliq, revisit the ViBe videos, and discuss with others.
7. Submit your work using the provided submission link.

**9.4 What comes after Case Studies?**  
After completing case studies, you move to the third component: **Practical Learning (Projects)**. You will contribute to real open-source projects, working with our developers to build real applications and add new features.

## 10. Ejection Policy

**10.1 What is the Ejection Policy?**  
The Ejection Policy is a structured mechanism designed to maintain a high-energy, focused learning environment. It ensures that the internship cohort consists of actively engaged participants who are consistently making progress. The policy promotes momentum, accountability, and fairness across the cohort.

**10.2 Why does the program have an Ejection Policy?**  
The policy exists to protect the learning ecosystem. Collaborative activities such as peer-to-peer viva sessions, case study discussions, and cohort-based learning are meaningful only when participants are equally invested. The Ejection Policy ensures that program resources are dedicated to committed learners and that prolonged disengagement does not dilute the experience for others.


**10.3 What are the types of ejection in this program?**  
There are **two types of ejection**:

- **Forward Eject (The Ascent):**  
  Participants who consistently demonstrate exceptional performance, sustained momentum, and high engagement may be elevated to advanced opportunities such as leadership roles, advanced responsibilities, or fellowship considerations.

- **Backward Eject (The Departure):**  
  Participants who remain persistently inactive or disengaged may be removed from the program to preserve the quality and seriousness of the cohort.


**10.4 What does “Backward Eject” mean?**  
Backward Eject refers to the removal of a participant from the internship due to sustained inactivity. This ensures that collaborative learning activities are conducted among participants who are actively contributing and progressing.

**10.5 How is inactivity measured for Backward Ejection?**  
Backward Ejection is triggered **only if both conditions are met simultaneously**:

1. Your average daily progress on the ViBe platform falls **below 3.33% per day**, **and**  
2. Your overall engagement level places you within the **bottom 10% of the active cohort**.

This dual-condition check ensures fairness and prevents short-term slowdowns from being penalized.

**10.6 Is the ejection process manual or automated?**  
The process is **automated and data-driven**. An algorithm evaluates progress and cohort standing objectively, ensuring transparency and eliminating subjective bias or manual intervention.

**10.7 Can I avoid being ejected from the program?**  
Yes. Maintaining steady progress above the minimum threshold and remaining actively engaged with the ViBe platform ensures that your position in the program remains secure.

**10.8 Is the Ejection Policy the same as the Discontinuation Policy?**  
No. The **Discontinuation Policy** addresses prolonged inactivity at an administrative level. The **Ejection Policy** is a real-time, algorithm-based mechanism focused on maintaining cohort momentum, engagement health, and learning quality.

**10.9 Can I appeal an ejection decision?**  
No. Ejection decisions are **final and non-appealable**, as they are based on objective, automated criteria applied uniformly across the cohort.


**10.10 Does being ejected affect future opportunities?**  
Backward Ejection removes you from the current cohort only. Forward Ejection, however, may open pathways to advanced leadership roles or fellowship nominations based on demonstrated excellence and reflective learning practices.
