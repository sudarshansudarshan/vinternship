## 9. MERN Case Studies

**9.1 What are Case Studies?**  
Case studies are the **second required component** (Advanced Learning) of the Pinternship program. They are well-structured, documentation-based lessons designed to help you apply what you learned in ViBe training through **hands-on coding**. Each case study focuses on real-world problem-solving, collaborative thinking, and practical implementation to help you become more confident with the technologies covered.

Case studies are organized by technology, including:
- TypeScript Fundamentals
- React Development
- Express.js Backend
- MongoDB Database

Each case study includes:
- Clear problem statements
- Defined learning objectives
- Step-by-step explanations
- Practical coding tasks
- Best practices and recommended patterns

**9.2 Are Case Studies mandatory?**  
Yes. Case studies are a **required component** for completing the Pinternship program. All participants must complete the case studies after finishing ViBe training and before moving to the Projects phase.

**9.3 How do I get started with Case Studies?**  
After completing all ViBe videos:

1. Click the **Case Studies** link in the navigation bar at the top of the page.
2. Select a **technology** and then choose a **lesson**.
3. Read the entire documentation carefully to understand the concept and tasks to be performed.
4. Try to understand each case study first, then attempt to code a solution for it.
5. Open a code editor (for example, **VS Code**) and implement the tasks.
5. Getting stuck is normal — ask questions on Cliq, revisit the ViBe videos, and discuss with others.
7. Submit your work using the provided submission link.

**9.4 What comes after Case Studies?**  
After completing case studies, you move to the third component: **Practical Learning (Projects)**. You will contribute to real open-source projects, working with our developers to build real applications and add new features.

**9.5 How do I submit the case studies?**  

1. Visit the submission form: Will be updated soon.
2. Fill in all required details carefully, including:
   - First name and last name  
   - Email ID associated with the internship

You can track your submission status, access the leaderboard, and view the dashboard by visiting the Pinternship Live Dashbord section on website homepage.


## 10. Ejection Policy

**10.1 What is the Ejection Policy?**  
The Ejection Policy is a structured mechanism designed to maintain a high-energy, focused learning environment. It ensures that the internship cohort consists of actively engaged participants who are consistently making progress. The policy promotes momentum, accountability, and fairness across the cohort.

**10.2 Why does the program have an Ejection Policy?**  
The policy exists to protect the learning ecosystem. Collaborative activities such as peer-to-peer viva sessions, case study discussions, and cohort-based learning are meaningful only when participants are equally invested. The Ejection Policy ensures that program resources are dedicated to committed learners and that prolonged disengagement does not dilute the experience for others.


**10.3 What are the types of ejection in this program?**  
There are **two types of ejection**:

- **Forward Eject (The Ascent):**  
  Participants who consistently demonstrate exceptional performance, sustained momentum, and high engagement may be elevated to advanced opportunities such as leadership roles, advanced responsibilities, or fellowship considerations.

- **Backward Eject (The Departure):**  
  Participants who remain persistently inactive or disengaged may be removed from the program to preserve the quality and seriousness of the cohort.


**10.4 What does “Backward Eject” mean?**  
Backward Eject refers to the removal of a participant from the internship due to sustained inactivity. This ensures that collaborative learning activities are conducted among participants who are actively contributing and progressing.

**10.5 How is inactivity measured for Backward Ejection?**  
Backward Ejection is triggered **only if both conditions are met simultaneously**:

1. Your average daily progress on the ViBe platform falls **below 3.33% per day**, **and**  
2. Your overall engagement level places you within the **bottom 10% of the active cohort**.

This dual-condition check ensures fairness and prevents short-term slowdowns from being penalized.

**10.6 Is the ejection process manual or automated?**  
The process is **automated and data-driven**. An algorithm evaluates progress and cohort standing objectively, ensuring transparency and eliminating subjective bias or manual intervention.

**10.7 Can I avoid being ejected from the program?**  
Yes. Maintaining steady progress above the minimum threshold and remaining actively engaged with the ViBe platform ensures that your position in the program remains secure.

**10.8 Is the Ejection Policy the same as the Discontinuation Policy?**  
No. The **Discontinuation Policy** addresses prolonged inactivity at an administrative level. The **Ejection Policy** is a real-time, algorithm-based mechanism focused on maintaining cohort momentum, engagement health, and learning quality.

**10.9 Can I appeal an ejection decision?**  
No. Ejection decisions are **final and non-appealable**, as they are based on objective, automated criteria applied uniformly across the cohort.


**10.10 Does being ejected affect future opportunities?**  
Backward Ejection removes you from the current cohort only. Forward Ejection, however, may open pathways to advanced leadership roles or fellowship nominations based on demonstrated excellence and reflective learning practices.

## 11. Viva/PES (Self-Healing Endorsement Network)

**11.1 What is the Self-Healing Endorsement Network?**  
The **Self-Healing Endorsement Network** is the official evaluation framework used for **Viva/PES**.

It is a **peer-driven endorsement system** where interns endorse each other’s learning and contributions. All endorsements together form a **connected endorsement network**.

For the network to remain valid:
- Every chain of endorsements must **ultimately connect to a certified “Jedi”** (i.e., a **Silver, Bronze, or Gold ticket holder**)
- Any group of interns not connected to a Jedi forms a **floating island**
- Floating islands are considered **inactive**, and endorsements within them **will not be counted**


**11.2 Who are the Jedi and what role do they play?**  
A **Jedi** is an intern who holds a **Silver, Bronze, or Gold ticket**.

Their role in the network:
- All endorsement paths must **eventually link to a Jedi**
- Jedi act as **anchors** that validate and legitimize endorsement chains


**11.3 Is endorsement mandatory to complete the internship?**  
Yes, **every non-Jedi intern must receive one valid endorsement** to successfully complete the internship.

Important points:
- Endorsements **must be completed within the given deadline**
- The final endorsement graph must **not contain any floating islands**
- Interns who remain **unendorsed or disconnected** risk **non-completion of the internship**


**11.4 How many endorsements can I receive or give?**  
- Each intern can **receive only one endorsement**
- An intern may **endorse multiple other interns**
- There is **no upper limit** on how many endorsements you can give  

However, a **tree with greater length rather than breadth** is encouraged to maintain strong, meaningful chains rather than shallow mass endorsements.


**11.5 When am I allowed to endorse someone?**  
You may endorse anyone **at your discretion**, after assessing them in any way you find appropriate.

Recommended best practices:
- Interact with the intern before endorsing them
- Ensure they demonstrate **sufficient understanding of the MERN stack**, **ViBe course content**, and **case studies**
- Maintain a **healthy and collaborative interaction** — there is **no hierarchy or superiority** among co-interns, so please ensure that you interact with your co-interns in a friendly manner as peers

⚠️ **Important Warning:**  
Endorsing someone with **inadequate MERN fundamentals** may trigger **audit penalties** for the **entire tree or subtree** connected to that endorsement.


**11.6 Can I endorse or be endorsed by someone from my own college?**  
Yes, this is **allowed**.

However:
- Endorsements within the **same institute may raise suspicion**
- Such connections have a **higher probability of being audited** by **Bhavna ma’am**

This is **not prohibited**, but interns are expected to endorse **responsibly and ethically**.


**11.7 How do audits work in the endorsement network?**  
Audits are conducted by **Bhavna ma’am** to identify defaulters and irregularities.

If a **defaulter** is identified:
- The **entire endorsement path** connected to that intern is audited
- A **50% health point penalty** is applied to everyone in that connected group
- The **defaulter and anyone who fails the audit** are **removed from the network**


**11.8 What happens if I am certified as “good” during an audit?**  
If an intern is certified as **“good”** by Bhavna ma’am:
- They become **eligible to be endorsed by anyone**, even if they were previously disconnected
- Their **credibility and trust score** within the network increases


**11.9 What incentives exist within the endorsement network?**  
The network is intentionally designed to be **self-healing and incentive-driven**.

Whenever a new intern joins a **valid connected endorsement group**:
- Every existing member receives a **5% health point increase**
- The increase is calculated as:
  - **5% of their current health points**, plus  
  - **5% of the new member’s health points**

This encourages:
- Formation of **strong, connected networks**
- Avoidance of risky or isolated endorsement chains


**11.10 What data is used to manage endorsements?**  
Endorsements are tracked using a **three-column dataset**:

- **Member 1** → the endorser  
- **Member 2** → the endorsed intern  
- **Action** → endorsement or de-endorsement

Possible actions:
- **Add** → Member 1 endorsed Member 2  
- **Delete** → Member 1 de-endorsed Member 2  
- **Default** → Member 1 is a defaulter and Member 2 is the parent in the chain  

This dataset is used to:
- Track endorsement paths
- Detect floating islands
- Conduct audits efficiently


**11.11 How do I submit endorsements? (Google Form instructions)**  
All endorsements and de-endorsements must be submitted through the **official Google Form**:

🔗 **Endorsement Form Link:**  
TBD

The form contains **mandatory sections**:
1. **Endorser’s Name and Email**
2. **Endorsed Person’s Name and Email**
3. **Endorsement Status**
   - `Added` → for endorsement  
   - `Deleted` → for de-endorsement  
4. **Remarks**  
   - Write short, honest remarks based on your assessment

📌 **Important Guidelines:**
- The form should be filled **only once per endorsement**
- The **endorser** should fill the form
- Avoid duplicate or reciprocal entries

<!-- ⏳ **Deadline:**  
All endorsements and de-endorsements must be completed **by Friday 16th January 2026**. -->


**11.12 What should interns keep in mind while endorsing others?**  
- Avoid careless, bulk, or reciprocal endorsements
- Ensure your endorsement chain **connects to a Jedi**
- Endorse based on **knowledge, effort, and contribution**
- Be mindful that poor endorsements can cause **audit cascades**

The Self-Healing Endorsement Network rewards **integrity, collaboration, responsibility, and accountability**.

<!-- **11.13 Will Bhavna ma’am conduct Viva sessions in the future so that interns can become Jedi (Bronze ticket holders)?**  

No, Bhavna ma'am will unfortunately **not conduct Viva sessions anymore**. She will only perform audit checks in the form of viva to identify defaulters/anomalies.
Earlier, clearing the Viva conducted by Bhavna ma’am allowed interns to become **Bronze ticket holders**. Since this process has now been discontinued, the **set of existing Jedi (Silver, Bronze, and Gold ticket holders) is fixed**.

No new Jedi will be added through Viva going forward. -->
