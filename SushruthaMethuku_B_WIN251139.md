Beginning my first internship has been a valuable learning experience that has helped me transition from academic learning to practical exposure.

Stepping into my first professional environment was both challenging and exciting. What started with uncertainty soon became a journey of learning, growth, and confidence. At the start, I had very little knowledge of the MERN stack and no idea what an internship truly involves. The process of diving into a professional environment was both intimidating and inspiring at the same time.

I recently started my Pinternship with VLED Labs, under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar. My journey began on the ViBe platform, where structured videos and quizzes helped me build a foundational understanding of the MERN stack. At first, it felt overwhelming to process so many new concepts, and seeing other cohort members progress faster sometimes made me feel like I was falling behind.

However, I quickly realized that true learning is not about speed but about understanding deeply. To reinforce my learning, I started working on case studies, which provided a practical and detailed perspective on each concept I had studied on ViBe. These case studies included challenges at the end of every lesson, pushing me to apply concepts, think critically, and solve real-world problems. By completing them, my doubts were clarified, and my confidence in the MERN stack grew significantly.

One of the highlights of this internship has been the mentorship and collaborative environment. Our mentors have been incredibly supportive, patiently addressing our questions during stand-up sessions and encouraging us to explore and experiment. Sessions with seniors provided additional guidance, valuable advice, and motivation. Breakout sessions with cohort members fostered collaboration, allowing us to discuss case studies, share ideas, and help each other overcome challenges.

Even in just two weeks, the experience has been transformative. Beyond technical skills, I have learned the importance of patience, perseverance, and structured learning. This internship has not only enhanced my understanding of the MERN stack but also introduced me to the professional culture of teamwork, guidance, and continuous improvement.

This internship will remain a memorable milestone in my life and will have a strong, lasting impact on my career journey. It has shown me the value of combining self-learning with mentorship, and how collaboration can accelerate growth.

🙏 Heartfelt thanks to VLED Labs , ANNAM.AI , Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar , NPTEL, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar and all the mentors and seniors who continuously guided, encouraged, and supported me throughout this journey.

I am excited to continue this learning journey, tackle upcoming challenges, and grow both personally and professionally.
