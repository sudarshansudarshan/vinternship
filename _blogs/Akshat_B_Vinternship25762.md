title: "My Vinternship Experience: When learning isn't marred by deadlines"

When I applied for this virtual winter internship, having secured a Gold medal in IIT Ropar's Joy of Computing with Python NPTEL course, I presumed the project and aligned training would be about GenAI, as that's what the email highlighting this opportunity alluded to. However, the training roadmap laid in front of us was aligned with MERN stack. Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, the course instructor and the kind professor who offered this opportunity emphasized during the inaugural meeting that most interns whom they assign projects to work on don't have the necessary foundation to work on them; which is why we are being trained in this ever popular stack of technologies, so that we can create any kind of application and understand the fundamental architectural requirements any web-based project demands.

Having been a part of this cohort for over 3 weeks, I would like to share my journey thus far. 

## First Week

The learning journey started with Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design's ViBe platform, where the first component was TypeScript. I learned various things, some (like decorators) require me to revisit them. We were also introduced to the cohort's dashboard that acts as a leaderboard to rank interns based on their progress and other metrics, which acted as a great source of drive, to do more. 


## Second Week

Having completed TypeScript, and transitioned into learning React's fundamentals, I was already feeling that some concepts were getting out of my grasp. Funnily enough, that's exactly when the team introduced case studies: a set of challenges that an intern must submit one-after-the-other that help practice and implement said concepts practically and understand common mistakes and pitfalls.


## Third Week

As React's lessons grew ever complicated, I started devoting my time more to solving the case studies, which have been a great help. The evening standups and weekend learning sessions with the development team at Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, like from the course instructor and senior dev Nandan Prabhudesai himself, were quite insightful as to how the platform works and devs' approach to scaling and solving real bottlenecks, along with inspiring experiences shared by fellow interns.

To sum up, the journey so far has been quite insightful and a great learning adventure for me. I would like to thank everyone at Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar and ANNAM.AI who made this possible.
