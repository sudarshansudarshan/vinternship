# When the Right Opportunity Finds You at the Right Time

## Introduction

When I received **97/100 in *The Joy of Computing Using Python***, I was genuinely thrilled. It wasn’t just about the score—it was a validation of the effort, curiosity, and late-night learning that went into it.

Soon after, I discovered that this course also offered a **Winter Internship opportunity** for top performers and certificate holders. Naturally, my excitement doubled. It felt like a door had opened.

But life had other plans—at least for a moment.

## A Delay That Changed My Perspective

Around **25th or 26th December**, I learned that students from other colleges had already started their internships and that the last date had passed. I hadn’t received any email. At first, I felt disappointed, confused, and quietly heartbroken.

However, with time, I began to reflect.

December was also the month of our **semester examinations**. Even if I had received the internship opportunity at that moment, I wouldn’t have been able to give it the focus and commitment it deserved. That realization changed my perspective—it made me understand that sometimes, **a delay is not a denial. It’s simply timing doing its job.**

Days passed.

## When Everything Finally Aligned

Then, unexpectedly, I received a call from my **Head of Department, Raju Kumar**, informing me that a student from our college had received a Winter Internship email. He asked me to check my inbox—just to be sure.

I searched everywhere. Inbox. Spam. Promotions. Nothing.

And then… there it was.

Right in front of my eyes all along—an email asking me to submit an **NOC for the internship**. The relief, the joy, and the disbelief that followed are hard to put into words. With immense support from my HOD, I completed the process and submitted everything on time.

Soon after, I received my **internship confirmation**.

## The First Step Into the Internship World

I was excited—but also nervous. It was my **first internship**, and my mind was filled with “what ifs.”

- What if I get stuck?
- What if I’m not good enough?
- What if everyone else knows more than me?

Then came **Thursday, 15th January**—my first stand-up session.

And in that moment, all my nervousness melted away.

## Learning Environment & Mentorship

I realized that we wouldn’t be rushed into projects. Instead, we would be **trained, guided, and prepared step by step**. The clarity, structure, and positivity from the mentors—especially **Sudarshan Iyengar, Jinal Gupta, Meenakshi V, Rohit Sharma, Harshdeep R., Sakshi Sharma, Nitin Sankar**, and the entire team—created an environment where learning felt both safe and exciting.

Along this journey, I was also fortunate to receive guidance and support from **seniors from the previous cohort**, who were always willing to help whenever something felt unclear. I’m especially grateful to **Himanshu P Dev, Pratheek G, Jaisree Ragavi J, Tanvi Nagrare**, and others, who patiently helped me across multiple subjects and concepts. Their encouragement and clarity made a significant difference in my learning experience.

## Looking Ahead

Now, **two weeks into the internship**, I can confidently say that the journey has been smoother and more enriching than I ever imagined.

I’ve completed **100% of the first stage**, moved into case studies, and learned new concepts without fear or pressure. Along the way, I’ve also made new friends and gained insights that go far beyond technical learning.

With **8 weeks still left**, I’m genuinely excited about what lies ahead—the learning, the challenges, the growth, and the opportunities that will follow.

This journey has taught me an important lesson:

> **When the right opportunity finds you at the right time, everything aligns—and growth happens naturally.**

Grateful for the journey so far. Excited for everything that’s yet to come ✨
