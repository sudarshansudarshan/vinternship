Walking into my internship at IIT Ropar through NPTEL, I was nervous in a way that’s hard to explain. It wasn’t fear, it was uncertainty. I didn’t know what to expect, how intense it would be or whether I would be able to keep up. But that feeling didn’t last long. The inaugural session quietly replaced my anxiety with clarity. For the first time, I could clearly see the path ahead and more importantly, the purpose behind it.

The internship did not begin with pressure, it began with practice. Learning the MERN stack through the ViBe platform was not a passive experience. It demanded patience, effort, and consistency. I realized that learning is not about rushing through topics but about showing up regularly. I consciously chose medium-paced, scheduled learning and that decision made a real difference. Concepts that once felt complex started making sense, and I learned how powerful consistency can be when applied daily.

Case studies were where my thinking truly evolved. They pushed me out of the comfort of tutorials and into problem-solving. In breakout rooms, something special happened. We sat together, brainstormed ideas, shared doubts and helped each other move forward. What stood out to me most was the environment there was no criticism, only collaboration. Instead of competing, we supported one another and that made learning feel safe and meaningful.

The stand-up sessions, conducted three times a week, became something I genuinely looked forward to. Listening to others share their perspectives widened my own thinking. Sometimes, we even discussed solutions to glitches or challenges faced. These sessions taught me that learning does not happen in isolation, it grows stronger through shared experiences and conversations. Weekend live sessions added another layer to this journey. Rather than wasting time on endless scrolling, I found myself using my weekends productively. Attending these sessions with a clear mind helped me stay focused and connected to the learning process.

When the sessions ended, what stayed with me was not just the technical knowledge of MERN stack, but a shift in how I approach learning. I learned to value consistency over intensity, collaboration over competition and understanding over speed. This internship did not just teach me how to code, it taught me how to learn, how to think and how to grow.

And that is something I will carry with me far beyond this internship.
