It has been two weeks since I began my Vinternship at IIT Ropar, and almost 20% of my journey is already complete. It still feels like yesterday when I sat in the introductory session listening to Sudarshan Sir speak about a path to wisdom rather than a race toward placements.



The first thing that stayed with me was his question:  

“Why are you running behind placements?”



He reminded us that fear-driven learning never builds real engineers. Instead, he encouraged us to build skills, do meaningful work, and let opportunities find us. That shift in thinking removed a lot of pressure I didn’t even realize I was carrying.



We were then introduced to ViBe — the Vikram Betal Portal.  

The idea itself was fascinating: just like Betal disappears when King Vikram loses focus, ViBe rewinds learning when you are distracted.



The platform delivers knowledge through:

\- 2-minute focused concept videos  

\- Quizzes that test real understanding  

\- AI-powered proctoring that checks readiness to learn  



If there is noise, another person in the room, or if your attention drifts — ViBe simply restarts the lesson. At first, this felt irritating. I struggled to adapt. Watching others complete modules quickly made me anxious and gave me a fear of falling behind.  



But slowly, patience changed everything. Instead of rushing, I focused on understanding. Over time, ViBe stopped feeling like surveillance and started feeling like a learning companion.



In the first week, I revised JavaScript and learned TypeScript.  

By the second week, I completed React and began working with MongoDB.



Alongside this, I worked on TypeScript case studies, which introduced me to real design thinking and patterns like Factory, Observer, and Strategy.



Daily standups became my favorite part of the program. The rule was simple: only positive vibes. No negativity, no blame, just learning and encouragement.  



We also had competitive quizzes with leaderboards — which surprisingly motivated me more than I expected.



On weekends, the experience deepened:

\- Discussions with seniors  

\- Conversations about improving ViBe, handling bugs, and scaling performance  

\- Hands-on practice building a task manager application  

\- Breakout rooms where we solved case studies with strangers who quickly became friends  



The biggest lesson for me has been consistency. Doing a little every day — some ViBe modules, some coding practice, some case study work — proved far more powerful than cramming or doing nothing.



I feel proud to be part of this adventurous learning journey — one that is shaping not just my technical skills, but my mindset as a learner and as a person.
