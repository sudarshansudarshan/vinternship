## My Internship Experience with IIT Ropar

I am currently part of the *Dijkstrians Batch*, which began in January 2026, where I am pursuing an internship under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, IIT Ropar. Through this internship, I have been learning the MERN Stack in a structured and collaborative environment, gaining valuable exposure to the transition from personal projects to building scalable, enterprise-grade applications.

One of the most valuable aspects of this internship has been its well-balanced learning pace. The deadlines are challenging enough to encourage consistent growth while still allowing time to deeply understand concepts rather than simply completing tasks. The curriculum delivered through the ViBe platform has encouraged me to step beyond my comfort zone and approach development with a stronger problem-solving mindset.

The live sessions conducted by Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar along with the VLED Labs team — Rohit Sharma, Jinal Gupta, Nitin Sankar, Harshdeep R., and Sakshi Sharma — have been highly impactful. These sessions combine strong technical insights with practical industry perspectives, making complex concepts easier to understand while motivating us to think independently.

The sessions held on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday have been a major highlight. Listening to peers share their journeys and experiences has been inspiring, while quizzes and interactive discussions help reinforce the concepts we learn. Additionally, sessions conducted by Nandan Prabhudesai have helped me understand the importance of system design and its role in building large-scale applications.

## Collaboration and Learning Environment

Like any new platform, we initially encountered a few technical challenges while using ViBe. However, the VLED Labs team responded quickly and resolved issues efficiently, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

What stands out most about this internship is its focus on collaboration and holistic development. Through standup meetings, breakout rooms, and peer interactions, the program encourages communication, teamwork, and professional growth alongside technical learning.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, this internship has been a meaningful journey of learning, exploration, and growth. It has strengthened my technical foundation while also helping me develop a broader perspective on building scalable systems and working effectively in a collaborative environment.

I am grateful for this opportunity provided by NPTEL, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, and Delhi Technological University (Formerly DCE), and I look forward to continuing this learning journey ahead.
