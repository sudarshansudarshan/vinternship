If you had asked me a few months ago whether I would ever work with the MERN stack, my answer would have been a confident no. For the longest time, I had this strange bias toward MERN—it felt too common, too “mainstream,” and honestly, I never tried to understand it beyond that perception. I had mentally written it off without even giving it a chance.

Everything started shifting when I began my current MERN stack internship offered by NPTEL through VLED Labs and IIT Ropar, and delivered through ViBe Platform.

What surprised me the most wasn’t the complexity of MERN, but how approachable it suddenly felt. ViBe broke down each concept—MongoDB, Express, React, Node—in such a structured and simplified way that I found myself actually enjoying the process. Things I used to think were confusing now clicked naturally. It wasn’t that MERN magically became easy; it was that the way it was taught finally made sense.

The internship itself is divided into three stages: learning, case studies, and project development. Knowing that everything I’m studying will eventually lead to real analysis and then a real project gives me a sense of direction and purpose. It’s challenging, sometimes a little scary, but in a way that motivates you to stay disciplined.

Beyond the technical side, this experience has changed me in ways I honestly didn’t expect:

💬 1. Learning from peers

Interacting with other interns has been eye-opening. Everyone is on their own path, with different speeds and different strengths. Observing that has made me more aware, more patient, and more understanding of how unique each learning journey is.

⏱️ 2. Respecting time differently

The structure of the internship forced me to rethink how I manage my day. I’ve cut down distractions, reduced unnecessary screen time, and become more intentional about my schedule. This shift feels small on the surface but has made a big difference in my consistency.

If there’s one lesson this journey has taught me so far, it’s this:

# We often dismiss something not because it lacks value, but because we never experienced it the right way.

With the right guidance, a supportive environment, and a structured approach, even something you once avoided can become something you genuinely enjoy and grow with.

I’m grateful to the ViBe platform and everyone behind this internship for building such a strong learning ecosystem. Excited for the upcoming phases and for everything this journey will continue to teach me—technically and personally.
