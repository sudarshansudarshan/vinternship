Learning was never competitive,
Learning was never fun,
Learning was never serious,
Learning was never a game.

Everything changed when I started using ViBe for learning.
ViBe, short for Vikram Betal, is a learning platform for the interns of IIT Ropar.
I am nothing but grateful for this opportunity.
I thought that the MERN stack would take years to understand and found it huge.

But the competitive environment, the dashboard, the team’s encouragement, and the Health Points kept me sitting at the edge of my seat, learning the MERN stack using this AI proctoring platform.

I imagined JavaScript to be really difficult, but the lectures of Nandan Sir made it easy to understand.
I adopted that language really quickly, and then understood the need for TypeScript also, and found it super interesting.

The breakout rooms after our regular standups and during the weekends helped me connect with other IIT interns and make friends all over India.
Imagine a cohort consisting of individuals who are elite-certified in a certain language.
If that doesn’t push you to be better, then nothing else will, and it did.
It pushed me to become better and learn faster and quicker to match their pace.

Slowly but steadily, I made my way towards React.
I won’t lie, was it scary? Yes, scary indeed during the start, but confusing later.
The topics bombarded my brain into thinking for hours and hours to understand the logic used in the programming language.
JSX, TSX, and the connectivities between different props and states got me stuck to the screen for hours, but it was worth it.

I am on my way to MongoDB, and I truly am grateful to be a part of the Euclideans Cohort.
The faculty is really amazing, and it wouldn’t have been possible without them and the friends I have made here.

I will keep updating my journey as I keep learning, but until that, let’s learn, let’s MERN.
