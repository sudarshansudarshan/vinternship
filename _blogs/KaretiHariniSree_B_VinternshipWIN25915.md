When I started my Vinternship journey with VLED Lab, I was introduced to the ViBe platform, where the MERN stack course was hosted, and from the very first module, it felt unfamiliar in a good way.

Each module on ViBe is broken down into extremely short videos—no longer than a minute or a minute and a half. At first, it reminded me of reels and shorts, the kind I would usually scroll through without thinking much. But here was the twist: after every single video, there was a quiz. And you couldn’t move forward unless you passed it.

Initially, this was frustrating. I remember watching the same video six or seven times because I kept failing the quiz. It felt annoying, and honestly, a bit exhausting. But slowly, something changed. I stopped watching the videos casually. I started paying real attention—listening carefully, noticing details, and understanding instead of just watching.

Over time, I began clearing the quizzes on the first attempt. Without realizing it, my habit shifted. What once felt frustrating became a quiet lesson in focus.

What surprised me even more was how my free time changed. Before this internship, whenever I had a break, I would automatically open reels or shorts. Now, that habit has been replaced by opening the ViBe course. Not because I was forced to, but because the platform made learning engaging through small challenges like health points, leaderboards, and progress tracking. These elements pushed me to stay alert and consistent without feeling like pressure.

Balancing college and the Vinternship wasn’t the hardest part. The real challenge—and growth—came from learning how to stay attentive, disciplined, and active in my own learning process.

The stand-up sessions have also been a meaningful part of this journey. They are interactive and welcoming, even though I haven’t spoken up yet. I still feel scared to speak. I genuinely hope that, as the sessions continue, I’ll gain the confidence to raise my voice and share my thoughts.

I can confidently say that this internship has increased my listening skill and made me more attentive, and more aware of how I learn.

Grateful for the learning journey with VLED Labs
