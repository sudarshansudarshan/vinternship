Most students think an internship is just about adding a line to a resume. To be honest, a few weeks ago, I thought the same. But my journey with the VLED Lab at IIT Ropar changed that perspective completely.

I was selected for this internship based on my NPTEL score, and I was over the moon. But due to strict academic commitments at my college, I had to make the heartbreaking decision to withdraw. I thought I had lost the opportunity forever.

However, life and Sudarshan Iyengar sir, gave me a second chance. I was allowed to join the current cohort. That moment taught me my first lesson before I even wrote a single line of code, that is opportunities are rare, and when you get a second one, you give it everything you have.

I am currently working through the MERN stack. I have finished the modules on JavaScript and TypeScript, and I am about to dive into React, MongoDB, and Express. But listing these technologies doesn't explain how I am learning them.

In college or on YouTube, learning is often lonely. You watch a video, you get stuck, you get bored, and sometimes you give up.

Here, we use the ViBe platform. It is a proctored learning environment. It sounds strict, but it is actually comforting. It feels like someone is sitting right there with you, ensuring you don't drift away. It creates a discipline I didn't know I needed. When I am on ViBe, I am not just watching, I am learning.

The biggest surprise for me has been the support system. Usually, when you face a bug in your code, it is frustrating. You feel stuck. Here, the developer team is always there to help resolve bugs and guide us.

Then there are the Stand-up Sessions. In the beginning, I was nervous about them. Now, I realize they are my daily dose of motivation. Connecting with seniors and hearing their experiences makes the goal feel achievable. It’s not just about "Positive Vibes Only", it is about real people helping each other grow.

As I prepare to start React, I am a little nervous but mostly excited. This isn't just a checklist of topics anymore. This is a challenge.

I am grateful to my college, R.V.R. & J.C. College of Engineering, for introducing me to NPTEL, and to the entire team at IIT Ropar, VLED Lab, and Annam.ai. Thank you for the second chance. I promise to make it count.
