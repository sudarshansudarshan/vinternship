&nbsp;    When I enrolled in the MERN stack internship by VLED Labs in collaboration with IIT Ropar, I expected it to fit easily into my routine. Since it was online, I assumed it would be similar to other virtual internships I had experienced—self-paced learning, assessments, and a certificate at the end. I did not anticipate it would be so structured or demand a deeper level of engagement.



&nbsp;    That assumption changed early on. Regular standups, meetings, and breakout room discussions introduced a professional rhythm that closely resembled a corporate environment. It became clear that active participation was essential to fully benefit from the experience. While I engaged when possible, I couldn’t network as actively as I wanted due to time limitations.



&nbsp;    The internship coincided with one of the most demanding phases of my life—my final year of college. Balancing interviews, exams, academic deadlines, and other responsibilities was challenging. There were moments when I was more observant than participative, not due to lack of interest, but because of competing priorities.



&nbsp;    Despite technical issues and scheduling conflicts, I continued pushing forward. These moments of friction encouraged reflection and resilience, aligning with the internship’s emphasis on iteration and improvement. Certain insights shared during meetings, especially by Sudarshan Iyengar sir, prompted me to think deeply about learning—not just as skill acquisition, but as a mindset shaped by thought and action.



&nbsp;    My perspective on frontend development also shifted. Previously overwhelmed by it, the structured learning approach and guidance from Nandan Prabhudessai sir helped me re-engage with confidence and clarity.



&nbsp;    Although the internship is still ongoing, it has already reshaped how I approach learning and time management. What remains with me is not just technical exposure, but a meaningful and transformative learning experience.
