There was a phase when I wasn’t very consistent in checking my emails. Even though I was always on my phone, I happened to see the internship message a bit late due to distraction and routine. By the time I noticed it, I was already close to missing the opportunity.

I still decided to register, unsure of how I would manage everything. Once the online internship with IIT Ropar began, my mindset shifted quickly. Attendance was mandatory, consistency mattered, and every evaluation—starting from the Vibe courses—made it clear that steady effort was non-negotiable. The AI-powered anomaly detection Vibe sessions truly glued me to the screen, making learning immersive and engaging. That structure brought discipline into my daily routine and pushed me to be more alert, organized, and focused.

I am currently learning the MERN Stack, and being new to it, the journey has been both challenging and exciting. The case studies are strengthening my syntax knowledge and increasing my eagerness to explore concepts more deeply. Breakout sessions bring together students from diverse backgrounds, allowing us to discuss ideas, solve problems collaboratively, and learn collectively. The interactive Standups and live sessions are surprisingly engaging and even fun, encouraging us to speak confidently and think aloud without hesitation.

Another aspect that genuinely caught my interest is Health Points. I find myself excited while learning about them and actively analyze ways not only to increase my health points but also to ensure they do not decrease. This awareness keeps me attentive and disciplined, making sure I do not miss any information, announcements, or updates shared through Cliq channels.

Through this journey, I am connecting with mentors and peers across India, including professionals from the infrastructure domain. These connections extend beyond sessions through LinkedIn and YouTube, turning the internship into a continuous learning network rather than just a ten-week program.

What started as a late-seen message has become a flip journey—one that is reshaping my habits, strengthening my consistency, and changing how I approach learning. This experience reminds me that growth often doesn’t begin with perfect timing, but with awareness, curiosity, and the decision to show up every day.

I am deeply grateful to Sudarshan Iyengar sir all the mentors who are guiding us throughout this program, ANNAM.AI , VLED Labs ,IIT ROPAR and my college faculties for their constant support and encouragement. Their guidance continues to play a vital role in shaping this experience and is helping me grow both personally and professionally.
