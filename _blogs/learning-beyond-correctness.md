## Learning Beyond Correctness

Before this Vinternship, I believed that learning was primarily about arriving at the correct answer.

If my output matched the expected result, I felt confident.  
If it did not, I assumed I had failed.

This was my understanding of learning at the time.

However, this Vinternship gradually reshaped that perspective.

Through case studies, discussions, and preparation for the viva, I encountered situations that challenged my assumptions. There were moments when I arrived at the correct answer but could not clearly explain why it worked. Conversely, there were times when my answer was incorrect, yet my understanding of the problem had significantly improved.

This contrast initially felt confusing. Over time, I realised that correctness and understanding are not always the same.

A key aspect of this Vinternship was the emphasis on explaining reasoning rather than merely presenting results. I was encouraged to justify my approach, clarify my assumptions, and articulate the logic behind my solutions.

This shift was impactful.

It required me to examine the shortcuts I relied on and to recognise areas where I had memorised solutions without fully understanding them. There were instances when I struggled to explain my own work, which was both humbling and instructive.

I learned that meaningful learning begins when confusion is acknowledged and addressed rather than concealed.

By observing how others approached problems and reasoning through challenges collaboratively, I gained an important insight: developers are not defined by the number of answers they know, but by how they approach problems they do not yet understand.

This Vinternship trained me to slow down, read problems carefully, and evaluate assumptions before attempting solutions. It emphasised thoughtful analysis over speed and completion.

While I continue to value writing correct code, I now place greater importance on understanding how and why the code works.

This journey did not simply teach me how to build solutions.  
It taught me how to think critically and learn effectively.
