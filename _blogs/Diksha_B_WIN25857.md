It has been three weeks since I began my internship journey with NPTEL at Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design and ANNAM.AI under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir & team . To be very honest , these past weeks have been filled with many mixed emotions - excitement, nervousness , challenges and growth .

When this internship was about to start , I was full of questions - What to do ? How to do? Will I be able to manage everything ? But instead of overthinking , I decided to just start. And I truly believe that having the courage to take the first step is often the hardest part of any journey. 

As this was my first internship and my first time learning the MERN stack too , I felt quite tensed initially. However , our very first session introduced us to a platform called "VIBE", where learning happens in an AI proctored Environment . While the idea of continuous AI monitoring felt frustrating at first but then I become habitual to learning in that kind of environment and started enjoying it too. What stood out the most is the concept of short ,reel-like learning videos specifically designed for today's fast paced world . And the quizzes integrated between the videos kept us attentive and actively engaged . It was so unique and a refreshing experience for me , to learn in this kind of virtual environment.

Also i had always assumed that virtual internships lack interaction , but those interactive standups with our mentors and meaningful conversations with our seniors & peers proved me wrong and i was so glad to be a part of this wonderful learning journey .

Moreover, this internship has taught me the importance of consistency .Consistency is not about moving fast ; but about moving forward every single day, even if the steps are small . But over time, those small efforts shape discipline, build confidence, and lead to real progress and i think being better than yesterday matters more than being perfect. 

As I continue this journey, I remind myself :

" Growth begins where comfort ends . ”
Because growth never happens where everything feels easy — it happens when we challenge ourselves, embrace uncertainty, and keep showing up.

Looking forward to learning, improving, and evolving every single day 🚀
