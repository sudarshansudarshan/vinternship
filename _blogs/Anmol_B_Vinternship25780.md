As most of us are trapped between assignments and theory exams during our college degree, it becomes difficult to implement what we learn without hands-on practice on real-world problems.

During my first and second weeks of the Winter Internship under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, I worked with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React through interactive quizzes and short-duration videos on the ViBe platform provided by the Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, as well as through case studies with proper documentation.

As a beginner, learning the MERN stack completely from scratch was very enthusiastic and interesting.

The challenges I faced were that most of our peers in the cohort were already good at MERN, which made me feel that I was far behind them and that my learning pace was comparatively slow. Along with that, some concepts were quite twisting, to the extent that I almost considered taking long breaks. However, I eventually made myself sit with the concepts and tried hard to understand them.

After a few days, I began to understand how interesting JavaScript, TypeScript, and React are. The case studies, in particular, provided me with more clarity on the topics and helped me gain in-depth knowledge.

I am truly grateful to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and his supporting team for their guidance and support, and to VLED Labs (Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design) for providing such a wonderful learning platform. I am looking forward to learning and implementing the remaining topics and gaining project-based implementation experience on these topics.
