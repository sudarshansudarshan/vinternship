Rejection can be discouraging but sometimes, it’s just a pause before something better.

I had applied for this internship during my 4th semester, genuinely hoping to be a part of it. Unfortunately, I was rejected the first time. So when I received another opportunity to apply this year, I was both surprised and grateful. Little did I know then that this experience would turn out to be much more than just an internship. It became a journey of learning, connection, and stepping out of my comfort zone.

🌐 The Zoom Session
Going into the online sessions, I honestly kept my expectations low, assuming they would be similar to the usual uninteractive virtual lectures we’re all familiar with. But I was pleasantly surprised.

The live and standup sessions were highly engaging and interactive. They proved that online learning, even behind screens and walls, can be incredibly effective when there is genuine eagerness to learn from both mentors and participants.

💬 Breakout Sessions 
The breakout sessions deserve special appreciation. They turned out to be one of the most effective tools used during this internship.

These sessions not only improved communication but also made it easier to clear doubts through peer discussions. They even helped us form teams for hackathons and collaborate effectively. Because of these sessions, the internship rarely felt “online” instead, it felt like being part of a unified classroom.

🚀 VIBE Platform & Case Studies 
As a beginner in the MERN Stack, I found the VIBE platform to be an excellent way to learn new concepts. What stood out the most was:

Short, 1-2 minute videos

Interactive quizzes in between

This approach worked far better for me than long, monotonous lectures. It reinforced the idea that learning can be engaging, concise, and effective at the same time.

The case studies further strengthened my understanding. Since they were directly based on what we learned on VIBE, they helped me revise and solidify concepts through simple yet application-oriented questions.

I’m truly thankful to NPTEL ,Annam.ai, and Sudarshan Iyengar sir for this wonderful opportunity. This internship has helped me grow not just technically, but also personally by connecting with people, collaborating in teams, and pushing myself beyond my comfort zone.

Sometimes, a rejection isn’t the end, it’s just a redirection to something better. ✨
