When I started the Internship with NPTEL at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, I honestly thought of it as something I needed to complete, learn the stack, finish the requirements, and move forward. I didn’t expect it to influence how I think about learning itself.

In the beginning, I was nervous. Not because of the tools or the MERN stack, but because of the bigger question running in my head: "Will I actually be able to keep up?" Starting from scratch makes the end goal feel distant, and self-doubt shows up sooner than expected.

What helped me move past that was the way learning was structured. The ViBe platform made learning feel active rather than overwhelming. The modules were short and focused, which made it easier to stay consistent, and the reflections and quizzes forced me to slow down and really check my understanding. Instead of passively watching content, I had to engage with it, and that made a noticeable difference.

Adjusting to this style took some time. Like many learners, I was used to long-form videos where everything flows continuously. This approach was different, but in a good way. The quizzes, especially, made me realize what I truly understood and where I needed to revisit concepts. That awareness alone boosted my confidence.

I’m currently completing the ViBe coursework, and even before moving on to case studies, my perspective has already shifted. I’ve learned that you don’t need to have everything figured out before you begin. Starting, staying consistent, and trusting the process matters far more than having a perfect plan.

The live Zoom sessions added something I didn’t know I needed. Interacting with mentors, answering quizzes, and hearing others share similar struggles made the journey feel less isolated. The breakout sessions, in particular, felt like open conversations rather than formal discussions spaces where questions felt welcome and learning felt shared.

One lesson that stands out for me so far is the value of consistency. Not speed. Not perfection. Just showing up regularly and staying curious, even on days when motivation is low. Over time, those small efforts start adding up.

This internship has already done more than strengthen my technical foundation. It’s helping me become more comfortable with uncertainty and more patient with my own learning process. I’m beginning to understand that confusion is part of growth and that progress often happens quietly, one module at a time.

If I had to sum up my experience so far in one line, it would be this:
**I’m not just learning how to build applications, I’m learning how to learn better.**

I’m grateful to NPTEL, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , and VLED Labs for creating such a thoughtful learning environment. A sincere thanks to Sudarshan Iyengar sir, Nitin Sankar, Rohit Sharma, Harshdeep R., Jinal Gupta, and the entire mentoring and support team for their guidance and encouragement throughout this journey.

As I continue with the ViBe coursework, I’m looking forward to what’s ahead, not just in terms of building projects, but in developing a deeper understanding, one step at a time.
