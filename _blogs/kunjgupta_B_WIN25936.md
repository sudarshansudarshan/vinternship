Recently, I had the opportunity to be part of the NPTEL Internship in collaboration with IIT Ropar, and it turned out to be a completely new and refreshing experience for me.

Going in, I expected it to be like a typical internship—understanding the organization’s workflow, getting familiar with the system, and then starting to work independently on projects. However, this internship was nothing like that, and honestly, that’s what made it special.

The journey began with learning the MERN stack through the ViBe platform. This itself was a brilliant approach. Instead of jumping straight into projects, the program focused on building strong fundamentals first. It helped clear concepts thoroughly and reduced the chances of making basic mistakes later while working on real projects.

One of the most unique and impactful aspects of this internship was the ViBe platform itself. It uses AI proctoring, which ensures that the learner is in a quiet environment and genuinely paying attention to the lectures. While I had already studied the MERN stack on my own earlier, I realized that I had rushed through many topics without fully understanding them. ViBe addressed this problem in a very innovative way.

The lectures are divided into small, focused sections, each covering a single concept. After every section, you have to answer 2–3 questions before moving forward. This method works incredibly well, especially considering today’s shorter attention spans. Instead of treating it as a weakness, the platform designs learning around it—and that makes a huge difference.

Another important takeaway for me was seeing the real-world application of AI. As a budding software developer, I’ve often felt anxious about AI replacing jobs. However, through ViBe, I began to see AI for what it really is—a tool. If combined with strong domain knowledge, it doesn’t threaten careers; it enhances them.

After completing the ViBe lectures, we moved on to case studies based on different MERN stack concepts. This was yet another thoughtful step. Watching a lecture may help you remember a concept for a short time, but applying it to real scenarios helps it stay with you much longer. Working on these case studies also gave us the chance to collaborate with fellow interns, which helped me push myself out of my comfort zone.

I could have easily completed these case studies using ChatGPT, but I consciously chose to interact with others instead. I wanted to improve my communication and social skills, and this experience genuinely helped me do that. Credit goes to the VLED Labs team for designing such a well-rounded and practical learning process.

This internship showed me how the Gen Z generation can meaningfully nurture technology, and I truly believe that VLED’s approach to education has the potential to set new standards in the future.

Now, I’m excited to move forward and work on the actual projects offered in this internship—and even more motivated for my future projects.

I’m deeply grateful to IIT Ropar, NPTEL, VLED Labs, Sudarshan Iyengar, Harshdeep R., ANNAM.AI, the ViBe team, and all the mentors for creating an experience that prioritizes thoughtful learning over speed.

This internship reaffirmed something important for me: meaningful learning happens when concepts, practice, and people come together consistently.
