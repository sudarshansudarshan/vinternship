When I applied for this internship, I assumed learning would be fast-paced—finish modules, solve problems, and quickly move on to the next thing. What I didn’t expect was that there would be no pressure to rush. I was given time to pause, revisit concepts, and understand things step by step. That freedom to slow down is what made this internship feel different from what I was used to.

Even so, learning wasn’t always smooth. I still found myself sitting with confusion, uncertainty, and incomplete understanding at different points—and learning to stay there instead of rushing past it became part of the process.

Learning through ViBe was structured, but it wasn’t easy in practice. The platform uses AI proctoring, which meant I needed a quiet and uninterrupted environment. Living in a hostel made this challenging. There was always some noise, people moving around, or activity in the background. Watching videos during the day became difficult, so I adapted by watching sessions late at night, when the hostel finally became quiet. It wasn’t convenient, but it worked. That experience taught me that learning doesn’t always come at the right time—you sometimes have to make time for it.

As time passed, I noticed something unexpected. Even though I watched the sessions seriously, I had forgotten parts of what I learned on ViBe. But when the MERN course moved into case studies, things started to make sense. Applying concepts, making decisions, and working through problems helped the learning settle. The case studies didn’t just revise concepts—they gave me confidence in how I think.

This internship has also taught me what consistency really means. Showing up even when I’m unsure. Trying to solve problems even when I don’t fully understand them. That kind of effort feels slow and sometimes uncomfortable, but it matters.

Breakout room discussions added another layer to the experience. Talking with others, hearing different perspectives, and realizing that everyone struggled in their own way made learning feel less isolating. It reminded me that learning isn’t meant to be done alone.

Along the way, I also started networking on LinkedIn—connecting with people, learning from their experiences, and realizing that learning continues beyond sessions and assignments.

I’m still early in this internship, but my approach to learning has already changed. I worry less about finishing quickly and focus more on understanding properly. I value applying what I learn more than just watching, and I’ve learned to appreciate questions as much as answers.

What stayed with me after the sessions wasn’t syntax or tools.  
It was how my relationship with learning began to change.

Confusion no longer feels like a wall to me. It feels like part of the process.

This internship hasn’t transformed me yet.  
But it has changed how I learn—and that feels like the right place to begin.
