Pursuing an internship in the third year of college is a dream for most students, and for good reason. Internships come with plenty of benefits. First and foremost, they help us understand how companies actually function. We get exposed to a professional environment and learn how to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. These are the soft skills that naturally develop while pursuing an internship.

Beyond soft skills, the core technical learning feels completely different. The code we usually write on our own varies greatly from the code developed by well-trained professionals in an industry setting. During an internship, we learn core skills in the way companies expect them to be implemented, which makes the learning experience far more practical and impactful.

By now, you might have figured out what this blog is about. Yes, this blog talks about my first stipend based internship. Like most students, I always dreamed of securing an internship at a reputed company or institution. From what I heard from my friends, internships usually demand strong prior skills and involve direct exposure to industry-based projects. Although I already had experience in full stack development, I often wondered whether I would get an internship that truly helped me showcase my existing skills and polish them in an industrial manner.

And that’s when an unexpected opportunity knocked at my door.

That opportunity was the NPTEL Winter Internship 2025, offered by IIT Ropar under the guidance of Prof. Sudharsan Iyengar.

At this point, many of you might be wondering how I got selected for this internship. Here’s the answer.

We are all familiar with NPTEL courses. A year ago, I completed the course “The Joy of Computing Using Python”, scoring 83% and securing a Top 5% (Topper) position. I had two main reasons for pursuing this course. The first was to evaluate and strengthen my Python skills. The second reason is honestly speaking was the number of academic credits offered. However, beyond these reasons, I gained something more valuable treasure: the opportunity to be part of the NPTEL Winter Internship.

My Internship Experience

I started my internship on January 14, 2026. Before joining, I had certain assumptions about how the internship would be. I believed I would be directly assigned to an industry-based project and would have to learn through a trial-and-error approach, while simultaneously managing stress and deadlines.

However, my actual experience turned out to be very different and much better than I expected.

This internship stands apart from many others because of its well-structured approach, which is divided into three major phases.

Phase 1: MERN Stack Course on the ViBe Platform

This phase focuses on strengthening our fundamentals in the MERN stack. It ensures that every intern is confident with the basics before moving ahead.

Phase 2: Case Studies

This is one of the most unique and exclusive parts of the internship. We are required to document case studies based on given problem statements. These problems are closely related to MERN stack fundamentals and serve as practical assessments that deepen our understanding through real-world application.

Phase 3: Projects

The third phase involves working on projects. By the time we reach this stage, our fundamentals are already strong. This naturally builds confidence and allows us to work on projects in a more structured and efficient manner.

Now, you might think that this is all about my internship, but there’s more.

Learning something new always comes with a certain level of stress. However, this internship goes beyond technical learning by including standup meetings, live sessions, and breakout rooms. The live and standup sessions are highly engaging. They allowed me to connect with my mentors, interact with them, and gain valuable insights. These sessions helped me overcome my fear of speaking to others and gradually improved my communication skills.

The quizzes conducted during the standup sessions were the funniest and most enjoyable part. They not only made learning interactive but also served as a great stress reliever. Breakout rooms provided an excellent space to collaborate with peers and work together on case studies.

Through breakout rooms, I got the opportunity to connect with peers from different states across India. That experience is truly beyond words. Beyond case studies, I am very glad that these sessions also served as a platform to expand my network.

Overall, these two weeks of the internship have taught me a lot, and I am still looking forward to moving ahead with a curiosity to learn new things. I am truly enjoying this internship to the fullest. Along with technical learning, this experience has taught me the importance of networking with people and has helped boost my confidence. I am extremely grateful to Prof. Sudharsan Iyengar sir and IIT Ropar for offering me this valuable opportunity, which has genuinely been a game changer in my learning journey.
