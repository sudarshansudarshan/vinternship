When I joined the **IIT Ropar MERN Stack Internship via NPTEL**, I had **zero knowledge of MERN**. I felt nervous and unsure whether I could keep up with others. Every session brought new doubts: *Am I understanding this right? Will I be able to do the case studies?*

What completely changed my experience were the **Zoom breakout rooms**. At first, I hesitated to ask questions, but soon I realized that everyone was there to **learn together**. I remember the exact moment when a peer explained a concept differently—it clicked instantly. That small moment changed how I approach learning: instead of being afraid of asking questions, I learned to **embrace curiosity and discussion**.

The breakout rooms were also where I made friends and learned about **different cultures**. With around 500 participants from all over the world, each discussion gave me a glimpse into new perspectives. That exposure stayed with me long after the sessions ended, reminding me that **learning is not just about knowledge—it’s also about connection**.

Working through the case studies, I realized that **struggling is part of learning**. Every doubt I faced, every mistake I made, and every discussion I joined contributed to my growth. I learned that **persistence, collaboration, and reflection** matter more than just completing tasks.

Even now, after the internship, what I carry with me is not just the MERN skills, but **confidence, a sense of curiosity, and the understanding that learning is better when shared**. Those lessons will guide me in every future challenge, technical or personal.
