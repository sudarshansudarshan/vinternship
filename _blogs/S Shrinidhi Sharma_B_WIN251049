Learning was completely different from the way I knew it. This was completely different from what have been experiencing in my college and school life.

The way of study was a completely new and getting started was a difficult task. But talking about moving on with it, I felt comfortable and confident. Slowly I started having progress, I have developed a way of learning that I never imagined of, and it was interesting.

While the doubts of 'is what am doing right' was still with me I continued to perform. The urge to stay focused and move on with the studies and flow was with me.

Vinternship helped me to be a part of learning that was way out of my thoughts. It helped me to be consistent, confident and even energetic. It helped me to know myself and my limitations and positives on focus and attention spans.

For someone who never experienced Vinternship I would say that this is a way of learning things that you might not have imagined but it's flexible easy to move on and productive. It helps you to move onto the next level of learning.
