It All Started With an NPTEL Exam
I never imagined that writing an NPTEL exam would lead to something this big.

Top 2% among students across India

My name featured in NPTEL’s CS toppers list

And above all…

An internship opportunity at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , under Sudarshan Iyengar sir.

This is my first internship, and honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this transformative.

Learning the MERN Stack: New, Challenging, Real
I joined this internship being new to the MERN stack.

Through the ViBe Learning platform, I started my journey step by step: JavaScript → TypeScript → React

Huge thanks to Nandan Prabhudesai sir for his beautiful explanations. Yes, the platform was slow at times. Yes, I got frustrated.

But somewhere along the way, I realized that even it was a part of learning.

AI Proctoring & the Vision Behind It
What really stood out to me was AI proctoring.

It forces you to:

Sit alone
Stay visible on camera
Learn in a quiet environment

If I'm not visible? I must rewatch the video.

If the environment is noisy? I start again.

At first, it feels strict. Later, it makes complete sense.

This clearly reflects the vision of Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design that Learning starts with a peaceful environment.

No other platform I’ve used has implemented discipline like this — and it played a crucial role in my learning.

Article content
Community, Cliq Channels & Professional Culture
The Cliq channels encouraged:

Peer-to-peer doubt solving
Professional communication
Strict protocol adherence

This itself shows the intent of our mentors — not just to teach tech, but to shape professionals.

I'm very much thankful to my mentors Harshdeep R. ma'am, Meenakshi V ma'am, Jinal Gupta ma'am, Rohit Sharma sir, and VLED Labs for the support and guidance.

Daily Standups, Discussions & Character Building
The everyday standups deserve a special mention.

I like Sudarshan sir’s words a lot which will make you not only think but reflect
Open discussions that make you think, not just listen
Topics that help you arrive at clarity instead of living in confusion
The discussions with my previous cohort interns also helped me in understanding the internship better and plan myself. They all have been very supportive to me.

Article content
The quizzes by Bhavna ma'am are superb good for learning and the health-point session by Sakshi Sharma ma'am is a bit scary😅

But I now understand — all these measures are about discipline, character, and professionalism.

Article content
Breakout Rooms & the “Strength of Weak Ties”
Breakout rooms became spaces to:

Brainstorm ideas
Discuss openly
Network with peers

When sir mentioned “The Strength of Weak Ties”, I could actually see it happening here.

Article content
More Than Just a Technical Internship
There are internships where we:

Learn tools
Write code
Implement concepts

But this internship goes beyond that.

We don’t just learn technical skills rather we learn discipline, which is equally important.

Networking, Competition & Self-Assessment
Doing this internship along with my classmates made it even better.

Connected with many fellow interns on LinkedIn
Built meaningful professional connections
Healthy competition through dashboards which i keep checking regularly!

It helped me assess myself and improve continuously.

From Classmates to Fellow Interns
Yes. Correct. Classmates became fellow interns and that’s something special.

A big shout-out to:

Navya Sri Mahadevapatnam
MADICHARLA SAI GANDHI
Nandu Manda

Grateful to be learning and growing alongside you all

Feeling grateful. Feeling grounded. Feeling motivated

Thank you!!!
