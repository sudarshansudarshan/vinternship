A Different Kind of Internship:My Experience with NPTEL at IIT Ropar


I am currently pursuing an NPTEL Internship offered by IIT Ropar, under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar. The internship started on 14th January and will continue until 24th March. I wanted to take a moment to share my experience and learning journey so far.


The internship is well-organized, with clear timelines, regular tasks, meetings, and evaluations that help us stay engaged throughout the program. The learning process is structured, but at the same time, it encourages us to actively participate and take responsibility for our progress.


As part of this internship, I am learning JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and MongoDB. What made the learning experience more interesting was the interactive and game-based approach used in many sessions. Instead of just watching and learning, we were involved in activities that made the concepts easier to understand and remember.


The live sessions, meetings, and breakout room discussions played an important role in the learning process. Working in smaller groups, sharing ideas, and discussing solutions helped make the sessions more engaging and collaborative. These interactions also helped me gain different perspectives and improve my understanding of the topics.


The assignments and case-based tasks encouraged logical thinking and practical application of concepts. They helped me move beyond just learning theory and focus more on problem-solving and real-world application.


Overall, this NPTEL Internship has been a valuable and enjoyable learning experience. It has helped me improve my technical skills, develop a better approach to learning, and gain confidence in handling new concepts. I am grateful for this opportunity and look forward to continuing this journey.
