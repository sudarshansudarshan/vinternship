When I first stepped into the world of technology, I was naturally drawn toward AI/ML and the powerful buzzwords shaping today’s innovation landscape. Advanced models, intelligent systems, and cutting-edge research felt exciting and futuristic. In comparison, the MERN stack seemed too foundational, almost ordinary. I never truly committed to exploring it in depth because I was more fascinated by what appeared to be the “next big thing” rather than the systems quietly powering it.

However, my perspective shifted during my winter internship (well known as Pinternship) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar. I began to understand that MERN is not merely basic — it is foundational in the strongest sense. It forms the backbone that allows intelligent systems to be deployed, scaled, and accessed by real users.

## A Well-Structured Learning System

The shift in my opinion is largely due to the structured and thoughtfully designed delivery on the ViBe learning platform powered by Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design. Concepts unfolded in a logical, layered manner that made everything click. What once seemed routine began to feel strategic and essential. This internship didn’t just teach me web development — it reshaped how I view the importance of strong technical foundations.

The internship is structured into three key phases:

### 1. The Learning Phase  
This phase focuses on building strong fundamentals in React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and deployment, ensuring clarity in core concepts.

### 2. The Case Study Phase  
This phase emphasizes analysing real-world applications, understanding architectural decisions, and thinking beyond just writing code.

### 3. The Project Phase  
This phase brings everything together by designing, developing, and deploying complete web applications, turning knowledge into practical experience.

What makes this journey impactful is its progression. Each stage prepares you for the next, creating a clear sense of direction. It’s challenging at times, but that challenge builds discipline. You’re encouraged to be consistent, accountable, and detail-oriented.

Beyond the technical dimension, the environment itself is deeply motivating. Interacting with fellow interns during breakout sessions has broadened my perspective. Everyone approaches problems differently — some move fast, others move methodically. Observing these variations has improved my collaboration skills and increased my awareness of different learning styles.

The biggest takeaway from this journey is that strong foundations matter more than chasing trends.

When learning is structured and guided properly, even the most “basic” skills can become the strongest pillars of growth and innovation.

I’m sincerely grateful to NPTEL, the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, and the mentors — Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, Meenakshi V ma'am, Jinal Gupta ma'am, Nandan Prabhudesai sir — and everyone involved in cultivating such a forward-thinking learning ecosystem. As I move ahead into the next phases of this internship, I’m excited not only about the projects I’ll build, but about the deeper understanding I’m continuing to develop.
