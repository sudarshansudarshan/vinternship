 title: "When Coding Feels Like a Vibe"

We often talk about "flow state" in programming—that moment when the logic aligns, the syntax disappears, and you are just building. But over the last two weeks of my virtual internship at **IIT Ropar**, I’ve realized it’s more than just flow. It’s a **vibe**.

### New Stack, New Energy
Walking into this internship, the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, TypeScript) was uncharted territory for me. Usually, learning a completely new technology stack feels like climbing a steep mountain, but here, it felt different. I really enjoyed the way the concepts were broken down; the teaching methodology turned what could have been overwhelming into something intuitive. It wasn't just about memorizing syntax; it was about understanding the architecture.

### Metrics of Momentum
This energy has translated directly into progress. In just two weeks of this ten-week journey, I have:
* Completed **100% of the Vibe Module**.
* Finished **25% of the Case Studies**.
* Started actively contributing to the **Vinternship site on GitHub**.

### From Learning to Applying
The most significant "vibe check," however, has been the transition from student to developer. This internship didn't just teach me *how to learn*; it gave me the confidence to *apply*.

I’m not just reading documentation anymore. I am currently coding my way through the **Ajraksha Hackathon**, taking the very TypeScript and MERN concepts I learned in the morning and deploying them in a competitive environment by night. That is when coding feels like a vibe—when the barrier between "studying" and "building" dissolves.

### The Architects of the Vibe
None of this "coders' euphoria" would be possible without the guidance behind the scenes. A massive thank you to **Prof. Sudarshan** for his incredible mentorship and to **Nadan PrabhuDesai sir** for those intense weekend breakout sessions—the quizzes and live bug discussions have been the highlight of my weeks.

Here is to the next eight weeks of keeping this energy alive!
