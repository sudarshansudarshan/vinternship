title: "Learning Beyond A Checklist: My IIT Ropar Internship Experience"

I realized something important very early into this internship: real learning does not feel like ticking boxes.

This internship was never meant to be a checklist. I did not realize that on day one, but I slowly understood it as the weeks unfolded. Instead of racing to complete tasks, we were guided through a learning journey that asked for attention, effort, and reflection.

Our journey began on the ViBe platform, and honestly, it surprised me in the best way possible. The learning videos were short — just about one to one-and-a-half minutes, almost like reels or shorts. At first, it felt unusual for a technical course, but it quickly made sense. In a time where attention spans are shrinking, this format worked perfectly. Each video demanded focus, and immediately after, there was a quiz. If you answered correctly, you moved forward. If not, you rewatched the video. Simple, but powerful.

What made it even more effective was that we had to keep our microphones and cameras on. There was no passive learning. You could not zone out and let the video play in the background. You had to be present. I genuinely loved this idea because it respected how people actually learn today — in small, focused bursts — while still holding us accountable. The quizzes helped me revise concepts instantly and made me aware of whether I was truly paying attention.

Because of this structure and consistency, I was able to complete my ViBe progress by the second week itself. That sense of momentum pushed me forward, and soon after, I began working on my TypeScript case studies. This is where the learning deepened.

While ViBe helped me build the foundation, the case studies forced me to slow down and think. I encountered fundamentals and details that I did not even realize I had missed earlier. Solving problems without step-by-step guidance made me confront my assumptions, gaps, and habits as a learner. It was uncomfortable at times — but that discomfort is where real understanding started to form.

During one of our stand-up sessions, Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir shared an idea from Mark Granovetter’s 1973 theory, The Strength of Weak Ties. He explained how growth and opportunities often come not from our closest circles, but from the weaker connections — people we interact with occasionally, who bring new perspectives and information. That idea stayed with me. It made me see learning not just as an individual effort, but as something deeply connected to interaction.

This became especially clear during the breakout sessions. These rooms brought together students to discuss case studies, doubts, and approaches. The learning that happened there felt richer than any single course video. Explaining concepts to each other, clearing doubts, and solving problems together gave me insights I would not have reached alone. Those discussions reshaped how I think about collaboration — not as dependency, but as shared growth.

Another aspect that quietly shaped my experience was the milestone system. We were given clear goals, time limits, and rewards in the form of HP points. Surprisingly, it never felt like pressure. Instead, it felt motivating. The deadlines added structure, but not stress. They encouraged consistency and made progress feel visible and rewarding.

Looking back, what stayed with me is not just the technical knowledge. It is the way this internship changed how I approach learning — staying attentive, valuing consistency, embracing struggle, and learning through people as much as through platforms. These experiences meant something different to each of us, and that is exactly what makes this journey meaningful.

This was not about completing an internship. It was about becoming a better learner — and that lesson will stay with me far beyond this experience.

I am grateful to the ecosystem that made this journey possible — the academic environment at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , the thoughtfully designed learning framework by Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design , and the collaborative innovation support from ANNAM.AI The guidance and mentorship from Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir throughout the internship played a crucial role in shaping not just my technical understanding, but also my mindset towards learning and collaboration. Learning in a space supported by mentors who value reflection, discussion, and growth made this experience truly meaningful.
