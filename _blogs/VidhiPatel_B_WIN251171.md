My Pinternship journey with VLED Lab taught me that meaningful learning is driven by intention rather than speed. I entered the internship expecting quick progress, but gradually realized that real growth happens through patience, reflection, and consistent effort.

There were moments of uncertainty where understanding took time and challenges required revisiting. Instead of seeing this as a limitation, I learned to accept struggle as part of the learning process. Regular engagement and a focus on understanding, rather than rushing for results, helped me build clarity and confidence over time.

Another valuable aspect was learning alongside peers. Sharing perspectives highlighted that everyone progresses differently. By the end of this journey, I became more reflective, resilient, and open to challenges. This internship reshaped not only how I learn, but how I approach growth moving forward.

Special thanks to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, ANNAM.AI, VLED Labs, and Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar.
