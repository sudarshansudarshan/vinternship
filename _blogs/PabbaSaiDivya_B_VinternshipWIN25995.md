# What I Learned About Confidence by Sitting With Discomfort


I have always felt most confident when I am learning alone. There is a certain comfort in watching lectures quietly, solving problems at my own pace, and making progress without anyone watching me struggle. When I started learning through ViBe and working on case studies during this internship, that comfort felt reassuring. I was learning, I was improving, and I felt in control.

At the same time, there were parts of the learning experience that I kept a distance from. Breakout room discussions, for example, made me uncomfortable. Not because I didn’t care, but because I cared too much. I worried about saying something incorrect, about asking a question that might sound stupid, or about slowing others down. Somewhere along the way, I convinced myself that learning alone was more efficient—that discussing ideas in a group was a waste of time when I could solve the problem on my own.

Working through the MERN stack and case studies reinforced this belief. I could struggle privately, make mistakes without embarrassment, and eventually figure things out. That struggle felt productive. But what I didn’t notice at first was how easily “efficiency” became a reason to avoid discomfort. Avoiding discussion felt logical, even smart—but it was also safe.

As the time passed, I started to notice something. Even though my technical understanding was improving, my confidence didn’t always follow. I could solve problems, but I still hesitated to speak. I still felt unsure in spaces where learning was visible rather than private. That’s when I realised something important: knowing more wasn’t automatically making me more confident.

Slowly, and a little uncomfortably, I began to understand that confidence doesn’t come from knowing everything—it comes from staying with discomfort. From not immediately escaping situations that make you feel exposed as a learner. From allowing yourself to be seen while you are still figuring things out.

This realisation didn’t suddenly change my behaviour overnight. I still find it easier to learn on my own. I still hesitate before joining discussions. But the difference now is that I question my avoidance. I ask myself whether I am choosing comfort or choosing growth. For the first time, I am trying to convince myself that speaking imperfectly, asking incomplete questions, and learning out loud are not signs of weakness—they are part of the learning process itself.

This internship hasn’t just taught me about the MERN stack or problem-solving. It has quietly made me reflect on how I learn, what I avoid, and why. I am still at the beginning of this journey—projects and real-world responsibilities are yet to come—but something fundamental has already shifted.

I’m still learning how to code. But more importantly, I’m learning how to stay present when learning feels uncomfortable. And that, I’ve realised, is where real confidence begins.
