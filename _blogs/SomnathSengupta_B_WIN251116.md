When I started this internship, I honestly thought one thing — we would be directly assigned to a project. I imagined jumping straight into real work: codebases, tasks, deadlines, and pressure.

But that’s not how it began.

Instead, we were first introduced to a **learning platform**.

At first, I didn’t fully understand the idea behind it. I wondered why we weren’t building something immediately. But slowly, things started making sense.

## Learning Through ViBe

As part of this internship offered by the **Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar**, associated with **NPTEL**, under **ANNAM.AI** and **VLED Labs**, we were given access to a platform called **ViBe**.

ViBe is a proctored learning environment. It constantly monitors whether you are actually learning — not talking to others, not switching focus, not spending time elsewhere. Honestly, this felt uncomfortable at first.

After every video, there is a **quiz**, and unless you pass it, you simply **cannot move to the next one**. No skipping. No shortcuts.

There’s also a **live dashboard** that shows progress — yours and others’. Without explicitly saying “compete”, it creates a competitive environment.

Initially, it felt strict. Slow. Even frustrating at times.

But slowly I realized something important —

>"This platform doesn’t allow you to pretend that you are learning.  
It forces honesty. And that changes everything."

## Case Studies: Where Things Started Making Sense

Along with videos, we were given **case studies**. This part genuinely helped me the most.

Watching videos is one thing. But when you are asked to **think, code, and solve**, you immediately see what you actually understood — and what you didn’t.

The case studies pushed me to apply concepts practically. They made learning feel **real**, not just theoretical.

This is where I started feeling like: *Okay, this is not just training. This is preparation.*

## Standups, Breakout Rooms, and People

We have ***three standups and two live sessions***, where organizers make announcements, conduct fun activities, and keep the environment light. Our **professor Sudarshan Iyengar** sir motivates us during these sessions, and honestly, that motivation matters more than we realize.

There are also **breakout rooms**, where interns interact with each other — discussing doubts, sharing ideas, sometimes gossiping, sometimes just having fun. But even these moments help.

One of the most valuable parts of this experience has been the special weekend meetings with seniors from the previous cohort (**Himanshu P, Dev, Ahana Sarkar, Pratheek G, Amruta Pattanaik, Shyam Patel, Divanshika Gupta, Divya Chhabra, Dnyanesh Agale, Jaisree Ragavi J**). Listening to their experiences and learning from the mistakes they shared gave us clear guidance on what to do — and what to avoid.

These interactions helped us build **connections** — something that is very important in tech.

Learning doesn’t always happen alone, and these sessions constantly remind us of that.

## Challenges, Pressure, and Motivation

Completing weekly milestones is not always easy. There is pressure.

But the **competitive live dashboard**, combined with discussions with other interns, actually pushes you forward. You get new ideas. You realize others are struggling too.

And that makes a difference.

## Where I Am Right Now

I won’t pretend that I’ve mastered everything.

So far:
- I’ve learned **JavaScript fundamentals**
- Started working with **TypeScript**
- And now I’m learning **React**

More importantly, I’m slowly understanding what **consistent learning** actually means — not just starting strong, but continuing even when it gets difficult.

## Ending Thoughts

This journey has already started shaping how I approach learning — even at this early stage. It has shown me that before building projects, it is important to build clarity, discipline, and consistency.

I’m grateful to **our professor Sudarshan Iyengar** for the constant motivation and guidance during the standups, and to the **VLED Labs team** (**Nitin Sankar, Sakshi Sharma, Meenakshi V, Rohit Sharma, Jinal Gupta, Nandan Prabhudesai, Harshdeep R.**) for creating a learning environment that encourages both discipline and discussion.

This is still a learning-in-progress phase for me, and I’m looking forward to growing further in the coming weeks — learning more, thinking better, and building with stronger fundamentals.

Grateful for the opportunity and excited for what lies ahead.
