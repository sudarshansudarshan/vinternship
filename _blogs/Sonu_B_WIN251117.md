I joined the winter internship at IIT Ropar thinking it would be about learning tools and finishing tasks. What I did not expect was how much it would change the way I approach learning itself.

From the very beginning, the experience felt different. Learning through ViBe meant there was no rush and no constant validation. You try, you fail, you retry. At first, that silence was uncomfortable. I was used to being told whether I was on the right track. Here I had to figure that out on my own. Slowly I realized that this was intentional. It pushed me to sit with confusion instead of escaping it.

As I worked through the MERN stack, something shifted. I stopped thinking about completing modules and started caring about understanding why things worked. Debugging was no longer just about fixing errors but about tracing my own thinking. That process taught me patience and consistency in a way no lecture ever had.

What stayed with me most was the culture of learning. Discussions, breakout rooms, feedback, and even preparation made me more aware of my gaps without making them feel like failures. It felt safe to not know, as long as you were willing to learn.

This internship did not make me feel like an expert. It made me more comfortable with being a learner. I now see learning as a slow, honest process, built through showing up every day, even when things feel unclear. That mindset is what I will carry forward long after the internship ends.

Once again truly grateful to be working with the finest of the craft, Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar
