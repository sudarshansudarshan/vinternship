This article shares my internship experience at IIT Ropar under VLED Lab. The internship gave me exposure to a structured learning environment through regular stand-up sessions and breakout sessions, which encouraged interaction, reflection, and consistency. This experience helped me improve my self-learning approach, gain confidence, and understand the value of discipline in a professional setting.
