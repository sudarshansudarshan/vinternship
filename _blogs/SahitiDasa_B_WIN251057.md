title: Learning Didn’t Go the Way I Expected

I joined this Vinternship thinking I would understand things step by step. Learn something, practice it, and move on. That’s usually how learning works for me.

Here, it didn’t happen like that.

Some topics made sense only after I struggled with them for a while. Sometimes I thought I understood something, but when I tried to apply it, I realised I hadn’t. That was frustrating, especially in the beginning.

Working through case studies made this very clear. They looked manageable at first, but once I started solving them, I noticed gaps in my thinking. Feedback helped, but it also showed me how often I assumed I knew more than I actually did.

Learning through ViBe required more self-discipline than I expected. Sometimes it even took hours to complete 1% of the course. There was no one reminding me to revise or try again. But this helped me to learn again and again till I understand perfectly. On days when I stayed consistent, things felt clearer. On days when I didn’t, confusion piled up quickly.

Group discussions helped in a simple way. Hearing others talk about their doubts made me realise I wasn’t the only one struggling. Everyone was figuring things out differently, and that made the process feel normal.

This Vinternship didn’t make learning easier for me.

It made me more aware of how I learn.
