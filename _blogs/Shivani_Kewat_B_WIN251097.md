title: "I Thought I Was Learning to Code - I Didn’t Know I Was Learning About Myself"

When I joined this internship, I assumed learning would feel familiar-watching sessions, writing code, and completing tasks one after another. I thought progress would be visible and measurable. What I didn’t expect was that this journey would quietly change the way I think, struggle, and grow.

The journey began with learning through ViBe. At first, it felt like just another learning platform. But slowly, it became something more. Learning here wasn’t about finishing videos or memorizing syntax, it was about showing up every day. Some concepts made sense quickly; others took time. Earlier, not understanding something immediately made me doubt myself. Through ViBe, I learned that confusion is not a weakness, it is part of learning. Consistency mattered more than confidence, and patience mattered more than speed.

As we moved from learning into case studies, the experience became deeper and more challenging. Case studies did not give clear instructions or instant answers. They asked me to think, analyze, and sometimes sit with uncertainty. There were moments when I felt stuck, unsure of whether I was moving in the right direction. But instead of feeling discouraged, I slowly began to accept the struggle. I realized that real learning happens when solutions are not handed to you, when you are forced to think like a problem-solver rather than a student.

Working through case studies also changed how I see mistakes. Earlier, mistakes felt like proof that I wasn’t good enough. Now, they feel like checkpoints-signs that I am trying. Discussions, feedback, and hearing others’ perspectives made me realize that everyone learns differently, and everyone faces doubts, even if they don’t always say it out loud.

As we approach the next phase, real project work, I feel a mix of nervousness and excitement. I know that the responsibility will be greater, and the learning will be more demanding. But unlike before, I don’t feel afraid of not knowing everything. This journey has taught me that learning is not about being ready; it is about being willing.

What stayed with me most from this internship so far is not a specific technology or concept, but a mindset. I learned to trust the process, to stay consistent even on days that feel unproductive, and to believe that growth often happens quietly.

I joined this internship to learn development. Along the way, I learned something deeper, how to be patient with myself, how to keep going without clarity, and how to grow without rushing the outcome. And as the journey continues, I now look forward to learning not just through success, but through every challenge that lies ahead.

Grateful to Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design for designing a Vinternship that focuses not just on skills, but on mindset and learning through experience.

Thank you to the mentors and team members at Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, Sudarshan Iyengar sir for the guidance, feedback, and learning environment that made this journey meaningful.
