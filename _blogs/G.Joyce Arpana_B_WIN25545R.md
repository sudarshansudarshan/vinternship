"Yes, There Came a Second Chance — And I Grabbed It"

Before I talk about my Pinternship journey, I want to share how I secured it—because that itself was a journey of emotions, decisions, and faith.

It was back in November 2025 when the list of selected candidates was released. I still remember the feeling clearly. I was overjoyed—this was my very first internship, and that too under Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar under ,that too under Sudarshan Iyengar sir put me over the moon, l was estatic.

Then came the unexpected blow.

The internship was scheduled to begin exactly on the same day as my semester examinations. I had no option but to consider handling both simultaneously. Around that time, Himanshu P Dev reached out to congratulate me. Both of us were excited, yet confused—we genuinely didn’t know how to proceed given the clash.

Himanshu decided to continue. I, however, backed off when it was announced that there would be a flexible part-time pinternship conducted later.

Without delay, I sent an email requesting the team to consider me for future cohorts.

To be honest, I was heartbroken. It felt like I had let a golden opportunity slip away. Questions kept echoing in my mind:

Did I make the right decision?
Will I even be selected again?

And then—on 4th January 2026—came the long-awaited email.

It was my second chance.

I was overjoyed. I immediately sent a heartfelt thank you mail. Yes, there came a second chance—and I grabbed it.

The Pinternship officially took off on 15th January 2026. From the very first session, everything felt well-structured and meaningful. Milestones were clearly laid out, expectations were set, and it felt like the runway was ready.

My first week went smoothly. We began with the MERN stack course on the ViBe portal, and I can honestly say I have never felt this focused while watching learning videos. ViBe lived up to its name—derived from the legendary tale of Vikram and Betal. At times, it genuinely felt like Betal was reminding me:

“Focus… or I’ll haunt you.”
From the second week onward, the breakout sessions began—and what a wonderful experience they were..

Having Mithra S , Deepak Mahajan , SREE LAKSHMI A G , Akanksha, Simran Kumari, Jaganath, Arnav to solve case studies was truly a blast. The discussions, the confusion, the clarity that followed—it all made learning feel alive

This pinternship has been a truly enriching learning experience, and I am genuinely looking forward to completing the journey.
