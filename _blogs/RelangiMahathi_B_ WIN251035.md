There were moments during this Pinternship when I felt lost. Not because I didn’t want to learn, but because others seemed to be moving much faster. Many people were completing ViBe quickly and appearing on the leaderboard, while I was still trying to understand things. Seeing myself not in a good position made me feel unsure and made me question whether I was doing enough.

At first, I thought speed was the most important part of learning.

Slowly, that belief began to change. I realised that understanding matters more than how fast we finish. The competitive environment did push me, but in a positive way. Instead of giving up, I started spending more time learning and focused on being consistent rather than rushing. The guidance and perspective shared by Sudarshan Iyengar sir during Stand Up's & live sessions motivated me .

“When I Stopped Comparing and Started Learning”
The real change happened when I started working on the case studies. That was when I truly felt like I was learning. I was no longer just watching or listening. I was applying concepts, thinking through problems, and writing code on my own. Many topics I had already seen in ViBe came up again during the case studies, and this time they felt clearer. It felt like meaningful revision and helped me realise that without practice, concepts are easy to forget. 

This learning experience felt different from what I was used to before. The breakout rooms made a big difference. Talking with peers, sharing ideas, and learning from different viewpoints helped me understand concepts better. At first, I felt nervous about speaking up, but over time that fear reduced. Regular discussions helped me feel more comfortable expressing my thoughts and slowly built my confidence.

This Pinternship quietly taught me some important habits and ways of thinking. Staying consistent, putting in daily effort, and focusing on understanding instead of speed became more important to me. My mindset shifted from trying to finish quickly to trying to learn properly .

 I am grateful to VLED Labs , ANNAM.AI , Sudarshan Iyengar sir , and other mentors for creating an environment that encouraged real learning and growth and Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , NPTEL for this opportunity .
