Two weeks into the NPTEL Winter Internship at IIT Ropar, and it’s already been an intense, rewarding ride. This is nothing like the usual “watch a few videos and earn a certificate” kind of program. It’s a full 10 weeks of hands-on, fast-paced work that really pushes you to show up every single day and contribute.

I’m currently working on MERN stack development under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, and the learning curve has been steep—in the best way possible. The first 14 days were all about understanding the Vibe platform, getting used to daily stand-ups, and collaborating with an incredibly sharp group of interns from across the country. It took no time to realize that everyone here is serious about building something meaningful.

What really sets this internship apart is the level of ownership we’re given. We’re not just observing or assisting—we’re actively building. Even though the program is virtual, the mentorship from the IIT Ropar faculty makes it feel like you’re working right inside a lab. The expectations are high, and so is the support.

Balancing this 10-week commitment alongside everything else definitely requires discipline, but watching the project slowly come together makes it completely worth it. If you’re an NPTEL topper or aiming for a Gold or Elite medal, this internship is absolutely worth considering. It’s one of the best ways to bridge the gap between knowing the theory and actually doing the work. Excited to see what the next eight weeks bring.
