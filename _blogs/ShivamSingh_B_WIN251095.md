Currently in Software Engineering Branch in Delhi Technological University (Formerly DCE), 27' Batch

February 1, 2026

I am currently in Euclideans batch which started from January 14, 2026, pursuing an internship under Sudarshan Iyengar, IIT Ropar, where I am learning the MERN Stack in a structured and encouraging environment, learning how to go from normal personal-level projects to enterprise grade applications.

One of the most refreshing aspects of this internship is the well-balanced pace - the deadlines are challenging enough to keep us engaged, yet not overwhelming. The course content delivered through the ViBe platform truly pushed me to go beyond my comfort zone and explore concepts more deeply rather than just completing tasks.

The live sessions conducted by Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar & VLED Labs' team ( Rohit Sharma, Jinal Gupta , Nitin Sankar , Harshdeep R. , Sakshi Sharma ) have been particularly impactful. They were not only technically insightful but also highly motivating, making complex ideas feel approachable and inspiring us to think independently. The standout sessions held Monday, Wednesday and Friday are very nice, hearing other people talk about their journey and how this internship helped them to prosper and quizzes to revise our concepts that have been learnt are quite a bargain. Also, sessions held by Nandan Prabhudesai, helps me understand the importance of system design in large scale applications as well.

## Standup Sessions and interactions with Sudarshan Sir and VLED Team

Like any new platform, we initially faced several technical issues on ViBe. However, credit where it's due - the VLED Labs' team responded promptly and resolved the issues within a week, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

What I appreciate the most is the program's effort to encourage peer interaction and collaboration, via meetings and most importantly via breakout rooms. Even though the internship is primarily technical, its design clearly focuses on holistic development, helping students grow in communication, collaboration, and other essential soft skills alongside technical expertise.

Overall, this internship has been a valuable journey of learning, exploration, and growth—and I'm excited to keep building on this experience.

Grateful for the opportunity that has been given by NPTEL, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar and Delhi Technological University (Formerly DCE) and looking forward to what lies ahead in the future.
