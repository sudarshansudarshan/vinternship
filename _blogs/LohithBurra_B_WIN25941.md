## Introduction

When I received the mail saying that I was selected for the internship at Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, and saw big names like Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, NPTEL, and Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, I was genuinely very excited. I honestly did not expect that scoring as a topper in NPTEL would land me an internship at IIT Ropar. Who would have thought that? It was surprising for me.

After completing the required processes, I finally received the offer letter, and that moment felt very special.

## Beginning of the Internship

My internship began with an inaugural ceremony conducted through a Zoom meeting. In that session, I was introduced to the overall structure of the program. I got clarity that I would be learning the MERN stack through ViBe, working on case studies to gain hands-on understanding of the technologies, and finally submitting a project to complete the internship.

At that point, I felt really good because I was about to start learning new technologies. But I didn’t yet realize that some parts of the journey would be challenging and take time to understand.

## Learning Through ViBe and Case Studies

As the internship progressed, I started going through the courses on ViBe. Some concepts felt simple and easy to grasp, while others were confusing and required more effort.

Alongside the courses, we were advised to work on case studies in parallel so that our fundamentals would become stronger. This guidance came through the stand-up sessions conducted by the support team. These stand-up sessions were also where we received important updates and announcements related to the internship.

## Peer Interaction and Collaborative Learning

There were breakout room sessions where we could interact with peers, discuss doubts, help each other, and talk openly about the topics we were learning. These interactions made the learning process feel less individual and more shared, which helped me stay motivated and engaged.

## Guidance and Perspective from Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar

The interaction with Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir has always been a strong motivation throughout this internship. He doesn’t focus only on technology but also introduces real-world ideas and ways of thinking, such as the Strength of Weak Ties and the Pareto Principle.

These ideas made me reflect not just on learning technology, but also on how I approach learning and growth in general.

## Reflection

Overall, this internship has been a learning experience not just in terms of skills, but also in mindset. I am still learning, still figuring things out, and still improving step by step — and that itself feels meaningful.
