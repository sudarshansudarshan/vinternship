Talking about my journey through this internship, no amount of words feels enough. It taught me lessons I never expected to learn. When I was selected for this internship for the second time, my emotions were mixed. I had been selected earlier as well, but at that time my exams were going on and I was honestly very scared. I kept thinking, How will I manage everything? Seeing my situation, Sir kindly told me that it was okay and that I could join the next cohort. When I received the mail again, I felt happy and grateful that I had been given another chance. But along with that happiness came nervousness. I started thinking about how everything would work this time — new people, different rules, strict systems. Somewhere in my mind, I was scared that maybe I wouldn’t even last two days. That fear slowly started fading from the very first class. The way Sir spoke, the way professors and teachers interacted — calmly, respectfully, and with clarity — reduced my anxiety instantly. For the first time, I felt safe in a learning environment. It did not feel like a place where mistakes are judged; it felt like a place where learning is guided. Soon after, we were introduced to the ViBe app for learning. The first time I opened it and saw my penalty score increasing, I panicked. The rules felt very strict — sitting properly, camera on, mic on, no talking, complete focus. Initially, I thought, “What is all this?” But when I actually understood the purpose behind it, my perspective changed. Those rules were not there to scare us. They were designed to help us focus honestly and learn with discipline. Every small video was followed by a quiz, and whenever my answer came out correct, I felt genuinely happy. That small moment built confidence in me. It made me feel, “Yes, I can do this.” After studying, I felt clarity. I felt that I actually understood what I was learning. I even learned TypeScript here — something that once felt difficult but now feels possible. Slowly, I realised that learning is not about just finishing a course. It is about showing up every day with focus, honesty, and consistency. The real challenge came during the case studies. For the first time, learning was not about watching videos or reading content. I had to think. Initially, I faced difficulty and confusion. Problems did not feel straightforward. But during breakout sessions, discussing questions with other interns helped me see different approaches. Solving problems together taught me more than studying alone ever could. Earlier, I only used to study. Now, I study to build solutions. I read a problem, pause, think, and tell myself — I can approach this in a different way. Case studies helped me understand how ideas turn into solutions. They showed me how real problem-solving works and how important thinking is beyond theory. This shift changed my confidence completely. I now feel confident in my skills and in my ability to figure things out. I have learned how to move forward step by step instead of panicking. One of the biggest changes I noticed was in my communication skills. Earlier, I used to hesitate while speaking English. I understood things, but I was scared to speak. Through live sessions and stand-up sessions, I pushed myself to talk. I realised that unless I speak, I will never improve. Now, I consciously work on my communication. I practice, I solve problems, and I even stand in front of the mirror to present myself confidently. Watching teachers and students from different backgrounds communicate so confidently inspired me. That day, I decided to try — and I did. I still feel a little nervous about the viva after the case studies, but now it is a healthy nervousness. I know that I will give my best. I trust myself more than I did before. One moment that stayed with me was my first breakout session. I was drinking water when I suddenly realized I had been moved into a breakout room. Seniors were there, and when they called my name, I panicked and even turned off my camera for a second. But then I gathered courage and spoke. I asked my doubts. They explained everything patiently — about consistency, studying properly, being active, and not being afraid of the viva. They reassured us that the questions would be based on what we had learned. That conversation gave me confidence. From that day onwards, speaking in small groups no longer felt scary. Despite college and internship timings clashing at times, the team understood. Stand-up sessions, live sessions, quizzes — everything was structured in a way that learning never felt boring. It was serious, but it was also fun. It was not just padhai — it was meaningful learning. Looking back, this internship taught me much more than technical skills. It taught me discipline, consistency, confidence, communication, and how to trust myself. What once felt overwhelming now feels possible — and that belief is something I will carry forward. 

I am deeply grateful to VLED Labs , Sudarshan Iyengar and all my mentors for designing such a meaningful internship and for their constant guidance, support, and encouragement throughout this journey.
