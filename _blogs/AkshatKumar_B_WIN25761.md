Embarking on my first internship, I was filled with a mix of excitement and a bit of apprehension. The virtual format added an extra layer of uncertainty—although I had face-to-face interactions through Zoom, it wasn’t quite the same as being in a physical classroom. I worried that I might miss out on important details or struggle to keep up with the fast-paced environment. But beneath those worries, there was an undeniable sense of excitement about trying something new.

As the internship progressed, my perspective evolved. I began to realize that learning wasn’t about physical proximity to the instructor—it was about consistency, engagement, and actively participating. This shift in understanding changed the way I viewed learning in a virtual setting, highlighting the importance of self-discipline and responsibility in an online workspace.

What stood out the most was the contrast between this internship and traditional ones. Most internships tend to feel like an academic course, where concepts are introduced, assignments are given, and a certificate is awarded. While this does build knowledge, it often lacks the real-world responsibility and industry mindset that truly shapes professional growth. However, at IIT Ropar, the experience was different. It demanded personal accountability, curiosity, and the drive to learn deeply. This internship wasn’t just about completing tasks—it was about gaining a solid understanding and applying the concepts in real-world contexts.

The Internship Structure

The internship is divided into three key components:

VIBE – Learn the MERN stack through short videos and quizzes.
Case Studies – Apply the knowledge gained to solve real-world problems.
Projects – Work on collaborative projects to strengthen skills and teamwork.

Learning MERN Through VIBE and Case Studies

The first week was all about familiarizing myself with VIBE, the platform that would guide my MERN stack learning. Initially, I felt a bit overwhelmed, but the unique structure of the program made it easier to navigate. Each concept is broken down into short videos, followed by a quiz to test understanding. If I didn’t get the answer right, I would revisit the content until I grasped the concept fully. At first, some of the topics seemed complicated, but with repetition and focus, they eventually clicked. The key wasn’t just finishing the videos—it was about truly understanding the material before moving forward.

By the end of the first week, I had completed the entire MERN content on VIBE. Since I already had some experience with front-end development, learning the full stack helped me connect the dots and see how everything fits together. With this knowledge in hand, I began applying it to real-world case studies, implementing what we learned in class, under the guidance of Nandan Prabhudesai sir.

Breakout Sessions

The breakout sessions were, without a doubt, the highlight of the internship. These sessions allowed us to dive deep into the concepts, tackle problems from the case studies, and collaborate with others. What made them so valuable was the emphasis on understanding and application rather than just finding the right answers. We would discuss the concepts in depth, share our thoughts, and try to explain things in our own words. This collaborative approach made learning much more engaging and enriching.

I am truly grateful to NPTEL, the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , and especially Sudarshan Iyengar , for creating such a meaningful learning opportunity. I also want to thank Nitin, Meenakshi V ma’am, Rohit Sharma sir, Jinal Gupta ma’am, Harshdeep R. ma’am, Sakshi Sharma ma’am, and Nandan Prabhudesai sir for their constant support, encouragement, and guidance. Their mentorship has made this internship an inspiring and impactful journey.

These first two weeks have been an incredible period of growth, and I feel both grateful and motivated. I’m excited to see what the remaining weeks of this 10-week internship will bring and how much further I can develop my skills.
