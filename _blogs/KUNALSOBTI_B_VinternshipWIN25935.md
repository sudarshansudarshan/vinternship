When I started this internship or "Vinternship", I thought learning would feel as a task  and boring. Instead, it felt real,competitive,natural and gamified. Starting with the ViBe platform(or vikram betal),it consists of short "reel type" tutorials of not more than 1.5 min and after each "learning reel" there is a short quiz regarding it ,all under the supervision of video and mic proctoring,where learning and answering felt easier than just cheating or copy pasting.The best part? it comes with a competitive leaderboard and hp(health points) system which felt like being in a virtual game and competing against my peers. The lecture qualities was top notch and in depth.There were days when concepts clicked instantly, and days when nothing made sense until I sat with the confusion longer than I was comfortable with. That discomfort taught me more than any smooth success could have.

Then the case studies ,they are just the hands on coding version of the lectures which is where most of us like me come out of the "tutorial hell" and get their hands dirty by actually writing the code and making something. Thoughtfully created case studies and ViBe lectures are a must experience for any student like me to have.

What stayed with me most was the shift in how I approach problems. I stopped looking for “right answers” and started trusting the proces-trying, failing, fixing, and trying again. Working through challenges on my own and then discussing ideas with others showed me that learning is not a solo act; it grows through shared doubts and conversations.

Consistency quietly became my biggest teacher. Showing up every day, even when motivation was low, changed how confident I felt about my abilities. By the end, I wasn’t just learning tools or concept-I was vibing ,that is learning patience, responsibility, and how to think like a problem-solver. This experience didn’t just teach me development; it reshaped how I learn.
