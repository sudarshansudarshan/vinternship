Three weeks have already passed since i started my journey with Vinternship offered by IIT Ropar through NPTEL . I was greatful for the NPTEL and Vinternship team for providing such a wonderful oppurtunity for students to learn and grow.

I can honestly say that the experience was very different from regular learning programs. It is not about just finishing lessons, but about understanding ,trying, failing as well as improving step by step. The ViBe has been an exciting platform to learn MERN course .While doing the course it gives Vikram-Vetal vibes - if the answer to a quiz is wrong, the video will be get replayed. The main factor here is AI proctoring which made the course feel like a serious learning environment, not just like a normal course. It keeps monitoring us and if we distract it gives warnings and penalties, so it feels well designed for students. The videos are like short reels, which are easy to remember, just enough to attempt the quizzes, so the learning never feels boring.

At first, i found it difficult to start the MERN stack as it was totally new to me. I even felt discouraged seeing more than a thousand videos and also quizzes to do. I felt like i would not be able to completed it. During the first week, some of my peers had already completed the course, as shown on the dashboard where scores are displayed — that actually motivated me to keep going.

Slowly, I started watching the videos and giving quizzes. Day by day, it became a part of my routine like watching a few videos daily and testing through quizzes made me feel like i had learned something in a day.

Not only learning concepts, but the case studies helped me to implement what i have learned and also standup sessions made my day as they were encouraging, fun and engaging. Breakout sessions with my peers were also a good experience. It made me feel like i was not alone and we are growing together. Milestones helped me track my progress without leaving behind and improve my learning discipline.

I offer my thanks to the team, VLED Labs Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design Sudarshan Iyengar Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar NPTEL for providing such a wonderful learning experience. I look forward to continuing this journey and growing with everyone.
