# Small Habits, Big Shifts: What a Vinternship Taught Me

Nobody told me this internship would change the way I think. I did not expect it to. I came in with a laptop, some basic knowledge, and the assumption that I would finish tasks, learn some code, and move on. But somewhere between the first standup and the last submission, something shifted — quietly, without announcement. And when I looked back, I realized I was not the same person who had logged in on Day 1.

## Week 1: Stress, Fear, and the Weight of 300 Faces

I will not pretend Week 1 was easy.

The standup sessions were the hardest part. Every evening, I would open my laptop knowing I had to show up — camera on — in front of nearly 300 people. My heart raced before each session. What if I said something wrong? What if I fumbled?

But something interesting happened after a few standups. I started noticing that others were nervous too. Everyone was figuring things out in real time, just like me. And slowly, that fear got lighter.

By the end of the first week, I had done something I never thought I would — I turned my camera on and spoke. In front of 300 people. In my own voice.

That single act changed something in me.

## Time Management: My Biggest Personal Battle

If there is one thing I struggled with deeply in Week 1, it was time management.

Between the ViBe sessions, the MERN stack content, the case studies, and the standups — everything felt urgent and overwhelming at the same time. I kept switching between tasks. I felt busy but not productive.

Over time, I started making small changes. Planning my day the night before. Finishing one thing before moving to the next. Going slow, because slow and steady actually moved me forward.

What felt chaotic in Week 1 had become a rhythm by the later weeks.

## Confusion Is Not Failure

While working through the MERN stack, I didn't just struggle with code. I struggled with consistency. Some days things clicked beautifully. Other days, even simple logic felt heavy.

Earlier, I would take that as a sign that I wasn't good enough.

Here I learned something new — confusion is not failure. It tells you where to slow down, not where to quit. The case studies reinforced this. There was no single correct path. I had to think, reason, and sit with uncertainty. That was frustrating — but also empowering.

## Such an Inspiring Teacher

I cannot write this blog without mentioning Sudarshan Iyengar sir. Every standup session he showed up with not just knowledge, but warmth. His words had a way of making even the most overwhelming days feel manageable. He did not just teach us technology — he modelled what it looks like to be curious, humble, and genuinely invested in others' growth. I am deeply grateful to have had him guide this journey.

## What I Carry With Me

This Vinternship taught me patience with myself, respect for consistency, and the courage to sit with problems without immediately escaping them.

Above everything — **small habits, practiced daily, create people you didn't think you could become.**

It trusted me to take my learning seriously, even when nobody was watching. And that trust changed how I show up.
