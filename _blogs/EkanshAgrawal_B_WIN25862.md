When I joined the VInternship, I felt unsure and a little overwhelmed. I expected clear instructions, but instead I was asked to think, explore, and figure things out on my own. At times, this was frustrating and uncomfortable. However, slowly, I began to understand the value of this process. The case studies pushed me to think deeper, and the feedback helped me see my mistakes differently. I learned that confusion is not a failure but a part of learning. This internship changed how I approach problems and taught me to stay patient, curious, and consistent even when progress feels slow.
