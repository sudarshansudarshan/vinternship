The first few months of this year were not easy for me.

Nothing felt stable. I couldn’t clearly see where I was heading, and mentally, it became harder to move forward. It felt like everything was stuck. During that phase, getting selected for this internship felt like something meaningful. It didn’t solve my problems instantly, but it reminded me that not everything in my life was going wrong. It gave me a sense of direction when I needed it the most.

When I started learning through the ViBe platform, the experience felt very different from what I was used to. The videos were short, and questions appeared every few minutes. At first, I found this annoying. Sometimes it felt like there were too many questions, and not all of them made sense to me. But slowly, I understood the purpose behind it. It forced me to stop and think about whether I had actually understood the concept or if I had just watched the video without absorbing anything. Going back and rewatching videos because I couldn’t answer properly helped me understand the topics more deeply.

The live sessions added another important layer to this journey. Interacting with others, listening to their thoughts, and realizing that everyone had their own struggles made the learning process feel more human. Those discussions helped me grow not only technically, but also as a person.

What surprised me most was how involved we could be beyond just learning. Finding bugs or issues on the website and reporting them made me feel like I was contributing instead of just consuming content. The cohort website and the leaderboard also added a healthy sense of competition, which pushed me to stay consistent and engaged.

The case studies helped me understand what I had actually learned and how much I could truly apply. They made me think about why things work the way they do instead of just following steps. That shift made a big difference in how I approached problems.

I have completed a full stack program before, but this experience felt different. I gained more clarity. I could remember the code better, understand it better, and write it with more confidence. It didn’t feel like memorization - it felt like real understanding.

This experience didn’t just improve my coding skills. It changed how I approach learning itself. I’ve become more patient when I’m confused, more disciplined with my time, and more confident in my ability to figure things out. At a time when many things in my life felt uncertain, this internship became proof that growth was still happening.
