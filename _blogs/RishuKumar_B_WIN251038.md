My journey toward [**Vinternship**](https://sudarshansudarshan.github.io/vinternship/){:target="_blank"} didn’t start with the internship itself. It actually began with the [**NPTEL**](https://nptel.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} course [*“The Joy of Computing Using Python”*](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs32/preview){:target="_blank"} by [**Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudarshan-iyengar-3560b8145/){:target="_blank"} . That course was my first real exposure to structured problem-solving, and completing it with a **Top 5% rank** gave me a lot of confidence. More than the certificate, it made me enjoy computing and thinking logically. After finishing the course, I received an email inviting me to apply for an internship from [**NPTEL**](https://nptel.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} and [**Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design**](https://vicharanashala.ai/){:target="_blank"} at [**Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar**](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, where [**Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudarshan-iyengar-3560b8145/){:target="_blank"} teaches. Seeing this connection felt exciting and motivating, so I applied without a second thought.

After the application process, a Zoom orientation session was conducted where everything about the internship was explained clearly that how Vinternship works, what is expected from students, and how learning here is different from traditional internships. That session itself set the tone: this was going to be open, hands-on, and driven by curiosity rather than just deadlines. Soon after, the internship began, and in the first week we started learning the **MERN stack** through the [**ViBe platform**](https://vibe.vicharanashala.ai/){:target="_blank"}.

The [**Vibe platform**](https://vibe.vicharanashala.ai/){:target="_blank"} had a very interesting structure. Each topic was explained through a short video of about 1 to 1.5 minutes, and after every video, an AI-generated quiz tested our understanding of what was just taught. The entire course was taught by [**Nandan Prabhudesai sir**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandan-prabhudesai-8a5574199/){:target="_blank"}, and along with technical concepts, he shared how software is actually built and managed in real life. Initially, I procrastinated a lot and kept delaying the course. But then my friend [**Ayush Tripathi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayush-tripathi-89265923a/){:target="_blank"} completed the entire Vibe course, and that immediately triggered my competitive instinct. Almost out of rage and motivation combined, I sat down and completed the entire course in **one single day**. That moment really reminded me how competition, when healthy, can push you beyond your limits.

After completing the Vibe course in the first week, we moved on to a more practical phase where we were given [**case studies**](https://sudarshansudarshan.github.io/vinternship/case-studies/){:target="_blank"} on **TypeScript**, **React**, **MongoDB**, and **Express**, which I am currently working on. At the same time, we also got the opportunity to participate in the [**Ajrasakha Hackathon**](https://vicharanashala.github.io/ajrasakha-hackathon/){:target="_blank"} conducted by the [**ANNAM.AI**](https://www.annam.ai/){:target="_blank"} team. I’m participating with a team of four members, and this experience has taught me a lot about team coordination, responsibility, and managing work together. These are skills that you only truly learn when building something as a group.

One of the things I liked the most about Vinternship is how **open** everything is. Almost all the tools and platforms used are open source. The [**Vinternship**](https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan/vinternship){:target="_blank"} website itself is open source, and my friend [**Ayush Tripathi**](https://github.com/fierce-adventurer){:target="_blank"} is an active contributor there. I personally contributed to the [**Vibe platform’s GitHub repository**](https://github.com/vicharanashala/vibe/pull/677){:target="_blank"} after finding a bug where videos could be marked as watched without actually watching them. Instead of exploiting it, I sent a patch to fix the issue. This mindset of encouraging students to explore systems deeply, even to the point of breaking them, is something our mentor [**Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudarshan-iyengar-3560b8145/){:target="_blank"} actively promotes. In one Zoom session, **Sudarshan sir** even asked students if anyone had found a way to hack the Vibe platform, and humorously pointed out that completing the course honestly would take less effort than hacking it.

Overall, Vinternship has been much more than just an internship for me. It has been a journey of learning, procrastinating, competing, contributing, and growing. I’m deeply thankful to [**Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudarshan-iyengar-3560b8145/){:target="_blank"}, [**Nandan Prabhudesai**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandan-prabhudesai-8a5574199/){:target="_blank"}, [**Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design**](https://vicharanashala.ai/){:target="_blank"}, [**ANNAM.AI**](https://www.annam.ai/){:target="_blank"}, [**Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar**](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, and [**NPTEL**](https://nptel.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} for creating such an open, encouraging, and real learning environment. This experience has genuinely pushed me forward in my journey as a developer.
