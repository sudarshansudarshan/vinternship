I’m currently doing the NPTEL Winter Internship, and it has been a good learning experience for me so far. The internship is still ongoing, and most of my learning is happening through the ViBe platform.

Learning JavaScript, TypeScript, and React hasn’t always been easy. Some concepts took time to understand, and I had to revisit them more than once. That process helped me understand things better instead of just memorising code.

The ViBe platform uses AI-based quizzes and proctoring, which made me take the learning and assessments more seriously and helped me stay consistent.

One thing I really liked was the standup sessions held on alternate weekdays and weekends. Listening to others talk about what they are learning and their experiences was motivating and helped me stay focused.

Overall, this internship is helping me build a habit of regular learning. I’m still in the middle of this journey and looking forward to learning more in the coming weeks.

I’m grateful to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar (IIT Ropar) and Vicharanashala Lab for creating such a meaningful learning environment. I would also like to thank the VLED team for their guidance, support, and valuable feedback throughout this journey.
