I was excited to join this internship at **Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar** because of two reasons.
1. **Sudarshan Iyengar** sir was one of the few teachers whom I came in contact with through **NPTEL**, via the **Discrete Mathematics** course—not because I was interested initially, but because I like mathematics. Later, I found out that it is a part of the Computer Science course.
2. I got an internship under **Sudarshan Iyengar** sir, from whom I learned the basics of programming and mathematics.

- Although, soon I was disappointed because I heard that I would have to watch a course on the **MERN** stack, which I never liked because it is used in _Frontend Development_. The platform on which I was supposed to learn was **VLED Labs**’ product **ViBe**, which was new to me.
- After struggling with the platform due to bugs and slow responses, I realized this was not the way I was most comfortable learning. For a 10-minute video, the system breaks it into around 10 chunks of one minute each and then asks 2–3 questions from each chunk—sometimes even asking questions from future chunks, which I mostly guessed and survived. By the time I completed 76% of the total course, I ranked in the Top 3 on the leaderboard, but even after that, I was disappointed with the website interface and interaction.
- Luckily, I was exempted from completing the course and allowed to proceed with Case Studies and the Project, for which I am thankful to **Sudarshan Iyengar** sir and **Rohit Sharma** sir, who informed me about it. I was relieved because my style of learning is to mostly do the work myself and then watch the lecture to understand if I missed something or to learn the correct way of doing it. After that, I started liking the case studies and project. Although I am yet to submit them, it was a good transition from the course trap to solving actual problems.
- Although the course was structured in a good manner, without any unnecessary information, and was equipped with the knowledge required for solving _Case Studies_ and _Projects_, I now look back and understand why it was made compulsory and forced on me before proceeding ahead.
- For now, I think this much story is enough. See you soon with some other real-life stories.
