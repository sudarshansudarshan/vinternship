I was excited to join this internship at **Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar** because of two reason.
1. **Sudarshan Iyengar** sir was one of the few teacher whom i came in contact with through **NPTEL** via NPTEL **Discrete Mathematics** course not because i was interested but because I like mathematics and later found out that it is part of Computer Science course.
2. I got internship under the **Sudarshan Iyengar** sir from whom i learned basics of programming and mathematics.

- Although, soon I was disappointed because I heard that I will have to watch course on **MERN** stack which I never liked because it is used in _Frontend Development_. And the platform on which I was supposed to learn is **VLED** Labs product **ViBe**, which was new to me.
- After struggling with platform with bugs and slow responses, I realized this is not the way I was most comfortable with because for 10 minutes video, the system breaks it into around 10 chunks of one minute each and then asks 2-3 questions from each chunk, sometimes asking from future chunk which I mostly guesses and survived. By the time I completed 76% of total course, I ranked in Top 3 in leaderboard but even after that I was disappointed with the interface of website and interaction.
- Luckily I was excluded from completing the course and allowed to proceed with Case Studies and Project for which I am thankful to **Sudarshan Iyengar** sir and **Rohit Sharma** sir, who informed me about it, so I was relaxed because, my style of learning is that i mostly do the stuff myself and then watch the lecture to understand if I missed something or correct way to do it. After that I started liking case studies and project although, I am yet to submit it but it was a good transition from course trap to solving actual problems.
- Although, course was structured in a good manner and without any unnecessary information and equipped with information which was required for solving _Case Studies_ and _Projects_ which I am now look back and understood why it was made compulsory and forced on me to complete before proceeding ahead.
- For now, I think this much story is enough, see you soon with some other real life stories.
