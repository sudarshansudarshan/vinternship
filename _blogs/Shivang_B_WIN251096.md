A few weeks ago, I stepped into my MERN stack internship at IIT Ropar with a mix of excitement and hesitation. As someone who's spent hours grinding LeetCode in C++, diving into full-stack web dev felt like a big shift. MongoDB? Express? React hooks? Node APIs? I knew the acronyms, but building real apps end-to-end seemed daunting—especially remotely.

What I didn't expect was how quickly it all started clicking. The structured modules broke down the stack layer by layer: starting with MongoDB schemas for flexible data handling, moving to Express for robust backends, wiring up React for dynamic UIs, and tying it together with Node.

This internship isn't just about code; it's reshaping how I think about development:

1. End-to-End Ownership 

Gone are the days of isolated algorithms. Now, I'm designing databases that scale, handling async flows in Node, and optimizing React components for real users. It's teaching me the power of a cohesive stack.

2. Remote Collaboration Wins 

Weekly stand-ups and peer code reviews keep the momentum going. Sharing React components or debating Express middleware with fellow interns from across India has built my confidence in articulating tech decisions.

Some days, merging branches feels messy, but showing up consistently is building discipline I carry into my personal projects. It's a reminder that growth in tech isn't linear—it's iterative, just like agile sprints.

Grateful to IIT Ropar's team and mentors for this hands-on opportunity. Can't wait for the project phase where I'll build something production-ready!
