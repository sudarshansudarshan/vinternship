title: "I Thought Struggle Meant Failure. I Was Wrong!!"

Before this internship, I thought learning followed a simple rule:

If I was struggling, I probably wasn’t good at it.

That belief stayed with me for a long time.

So when the MERN course began and things didn’t immediately make sense, my first reaction wasn’t curiosity—it was self-doubt. I wondered if everyone else was understanding faster, if I was falling behind, if I was doing something wrong. There were days when opening the platform felt heavier than it should have.

But learning on ViBe didn’t allow me to hide behind comfort.

I couldn’t just watch and move on. I had to try. And when I tried, I failed—quietly, repeatedly, sometimes without even knowing why. At first, that was frustrating. Then, slowly, it became familiar. Showing up every day mattered more than feeling confident. Consistency became something I practiced, not something I already had.

Case studies were where everything felt real. There were no clear instructions telling me what the “right” answer was. I had to think, make choices, and accept uncertainty. It was uncomfortable. But somewhere in that discomfort, I realised something important: learning isn’t about avoiding confusion—it’s about sitting with it long enough for clarity to arrive.

Working with others showed me that struggle wasn’t personal. Everyone had their own moments of doubt, even if they didn’t always say it out loud. Breakout room discussions made me talk to people I never expected I would. Sometimes growth looks like asking a question you were scared to ask. Sometimes it looks like understanding your mistake for the first time.

What stayed with me after everything ended wasn’t just the technical knowledge. It was a shift in how I see myself as a learner.

I no longer panic when I don’t understand something immediately. I no longer believe that confusion means failure. I’ve learned that progress can be slow, uneven, and still meaningful.

This internship didn’t make me feel “finished.”

It made me feel capable of continuing.

And that’s something I’ll carry with me far beyond this experience.
