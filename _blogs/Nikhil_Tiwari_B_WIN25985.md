Sometimes growth doesn’t feel dramatic. It happens quietly while you’re just trying to keep up.

When this internship began, it didn’t start with big projects or coding marathons. Instead, we entered through the ViBe learning platform, where learning works in an interesting way. The name itself reminds us of the Vikram and Betal story — where Betal sticks around until the puzzle is solved.

And that’s exactly how learning felt here. You cannot just skip ahead. Concepts stay with you until you complete the quizzes and truly understand them before moving forward. No shortcuts. Just real learning.

Slowly, videos turned into understanding, and quizzes became checkpoints showing actual progress.

What made things more interesting was the leaderboard. Everyone could see their progress, ranking, and activity. But instead of pure competition, it created motivation.

We also earn HP — Health Points by completing activities, following guidelines, and even helping fellow interns. Helping someone else actually boosts your own points, which makes collaboration more valuable than competition. And honestly, that’s what made the environment supportive.

Then came case studies, where concepts stopped being theoretical and started looking like real-world problems. After that, we moved closer to project work, and things started feeling real.

Daily stand-up meetings helped us connect. At first, they felt formal, but over time, they became moments where teammates supported each other, shared progress, and even made friends along the way.

Now, working together in hackathons has pushed collaboration even further. Time pressure, teamwork, brainstorming — it all teaches lessons beyond textbooks.

One thought shared by @Sudarshan Iyengar Sir that stayed with me is the idea of “strength in weak ties.” Sometimes, opportunities and learning don’t only come from close circles but from the wider network we build — small interactions, teammates, mentors, and people we meet during such journeys. This internship truly helped create those connections.

The encouragement and philosophy shared by mentors, including Professor Sobhit, have made the journey motivating and positive. Learning felt less like pressure and more like exploration.

And somewhere in the middle of all this learning, collaboration, and growth, one simple developer moment captures how this whole experience feels:

This internship feels like the beginning of something much bigger — a journey where progress continues forward.

“The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.” — Lao Tzu

Grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow through this journey with @AMAN.ai, guided by mentors and the ecosystem supported by @IIT Ropar.

And honestly, this feels like just the start.
