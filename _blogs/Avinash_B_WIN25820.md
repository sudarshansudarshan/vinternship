This Exiciting winter internship at IIT Ropar with a very simple expectation: learn a few technologies and complete whatever tasks were assigned. That assumption didn’t last very long.

The first thing that surprised me was how quiet the learning felt. ViBe didn’t rush me, and it didn’t tell me when I was right. I would try something, get stuck, rethink it, and try again—often without any immediate feedback. In the beginning, that made me uneasy. I was so used to external confirmation that I didn’t know how to trust my own understanding. Slowly, I began to see why the process was designed this way.

While working through the MERN stack, I noticed a change in how I approached problems. I stopped chasing completion and started paying attention to my reasoning. When something broke, I didn’t jump straight to fixing it. I paused to understand where my thinking went wrong. That pause became an important part of my learning. It taught me to slow down and stay consistent, even when progress wasn’t visible.

What made this experience meaningful was the environment around it. Conversations in breakout rooms, preparation for evaluations, and the feedback I received helped me see my gaps clearly—without feeling judged for them. It became okay to say “I don’t know,” as long as I was willing to explore further.

This internship didn’t give me a feeling of mastery. Instead, it gave me something more valuable—a comfort with uncertainty. I now understand that learning is not about speed or certainty, but about honesty, patience, and showing up again the next day.

I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to learn under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and for the ecosystem created by Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, ANNAM.AI, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar.
