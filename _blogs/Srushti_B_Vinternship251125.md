title: "I Thought I Was Falling Behind. The Vinternship Taught Me Otherwise."

There were days during the Vinternship when I felt I was moving too slowly.

Others seemed to understand faster. Concepts clicked for them quickly. For me, they didn’t.
And for the first time, I stopped hiding that discomfort from myself.

Learning on ViBe wasn’t passive. It demanded attention, effort, and patience.
I had been a procrastinator earlier—waiting for pressure to force action.
This Vinternship helped me slow down and build persistence.

I have just started the case studies and completed a few so far.
Even in this early stage, I noticed a change.
I was thinking more and rushing less.

Consistency became more important than motivation.
Showing up mattered more than feeling confident.

It helped me move from procrastinating under pressure to showing up with intention.

I am truly grateful to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir for his guidance and support,
and to the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar for providing such a wonderful learning platform.

This Vinternship didn’t make me perfect.  
It made me patient.  
And that’s a skill I didn’t know I needed.
