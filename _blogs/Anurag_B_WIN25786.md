Wait, wait, wait—before jumping onto the experience of my first internship, I would like to share how this started.

It was a normal college day of the 2nd semester. I attended my first C language lab, and I was very excited to actually experience how it works. I wrote my first “Hello World” program. From that day, I became fond of coding—from printing simple Hello World programs to making full-fledged projects, and a lot more.

In this journey, I was soon introduced to the Python NPTEL course. I completed that course and scored 91%, which may not be the best I can do, but it is still a good score.

Then came a day when I received an email regarding this internship. I was very excited and grateful for that opportunity. I applied for it and received my offer letter.

Now comes the best part—the experience 😁.

This internship is not like every other internship- it is more than just an internship. In the very first session with Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, I personally learned many things, and this guidance did not stop there—it has been continuous throughout.

This internship introduced me to the MERN stack. I always wanted to start learning MERN, but I couldn’t find an appropriate source or a proper starting point. Here, I began my MERN journey—starting from the fundamentals of JavaScript and TypeScript to advanced concepts of React, and from MongoDB to Express.js. The way the concepts were taught to us by Nandan Prabhudesai Sir was very insightful and well-structured, which made learning complex topics much easier.

This internship is structured in a way that allows a student to participate in it along with college. We are introduced to many activities and tasks that make it more interesting than just studying and building projects. If someone gets stuck at any point, there is always a mentor or a peer to help. There are also breakout rooms for interaction and collaborative learning with everyone.

The best thing about this internship is that there are students from all over India, each with different mindsets. I learned many things from them as well. There is also a healthy competition among all the cohort members, which pushes me to give my best.

Overall, this internship has helped me a lot in staying consistent and disciplined. In the true sense, it is not just an internship but an overall development initiative by NPTEL and IIT Ropar.
