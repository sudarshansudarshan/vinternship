The first line of code I wrote for the VLED Lab internship was perfect. It was a console.log("Hello World"), copied precisely from the ViBe module. For a glorious moment, I felt like a developer. Then the real work began, and that feeling vanished, replaced by a persistent, low-grade panic. This blog isn't about how I conquered that panic, but how I am learning to sit with it, to let it guide me rather than paralyze me.

I'm writing this from an honest place—the journey is still very much in progress. I'm navigating the hands-on MERN stack course on ViBe, and I haven't yet reached the case studies or the real project phase. But in these three weeks, the learning has been profound, not in the form of a finished certificate, but as a shift in my daily reality.

The ViBe course is an immersive plunge. There is no gentle theory before practice. It's “here’s a concept,” and immediately, “now build this.” I remember staring at a failing API endpoint for what felt like an eternity. The error message was a wall of red text that seemed to mock my efforts.My old student instinct was to shut down, to wait for a solution to be presented. But the structure of this internship invites a different response: to sit with the problem, to read the error carefully, to search, to adjust, and to learn something new with each attempt. My small victory wasn't a perfect project; it was the moment I realized I could actually decipher why the code broke. I am learning that understanding failure is the real first step.

This process has quietly changed my approach. I’ve started to see each module not as a box to tick, but as a new set of tools. When I get stuck now, my first thought is less "I don't know this" and more "Let me trace the data flow" or "Let me check the logs." The panic is still there, but it now shares space with a flicker of curiosity. I'm beginning to understand that coding is less about memorizing syntax and more about developing a persistent, problem-solving mindset.

I’ve also had glimpses of the collaboration to come. While in-depth breakout room discussions for case studies are ahead of me, even the shared struggle in the cohort's communication channels has been revealing. Seeing others ask the "silly" questions I was too afraid to ask has given me permission to be a beginner. It has shown me that this journey isn't a solitary sprint but a shared climb.

I know the path ahead holds greater challenges—the case studies that will test my reasoning and the real project where learning becomes a responsibility. I haven't experienced those yet, and I'm apprehensive. But the first three weeks have given me something crucial: a changed relationship with not knowing.

My key takeaway so far is this: the goal isn't to reach a point where you never feel lost. The goal is to build the resilience to be productive while you're lost. The magic isn't waiting for me at the finish line; it's happening right now, in the daily grind of debugging and in the quiet acceptance that being in the uncomfortable middle is exactly where I need to be.

This vinternship is teaching me to find my voice not as an expert, but as a learner who is unafraid to engage with the struggle. And for now, that's enough
