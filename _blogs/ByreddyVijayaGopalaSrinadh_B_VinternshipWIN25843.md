I was very excited when I got the opportunity to start my internship journey at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar . It felt special and meaningful to be part of such a learning environment. From the first day, I felt happy and motivated to learn and explore technology in a practical way.

The learning process was completely hands-on through ViBe, while learning the MERN stack. Every day, I eagerly practiced the topics that were taught. Some topics were easy, and some were difficult, but learning step by step helped me understand better. While learning MERN, I also struggled with consistency. Some days things worked well, and other days even simple logic felt hard. This Vinternship taught me that confusion is not failure, it only means I need to slow down and learn better.

We were given milestones to complete within a fixed time. These milestones pushed me to work faster and stay focused. At first, it was challenging, but later I realized that it helped me manage my time better and improve my work speed.

After the topics were taught in class, case studies were given on those topics. Working on them helped me practice again and remember the concepts better. I could see where I was making mistakes and correct them. Even when it was a bit difficult, it really helped me learn better.

The stand-up sessions were very helpful. They gave me a chance to talk about my progress and listen to others. Whenever I had doubts or problems, Nithin Sir and Rohit Sir supported us and guided us well.

I also enjoyed the breakout sessions after the stand-up meetings. These sessions were interactive and made learning enjoyable. Sharing ideas and learning from others helped me grow with confidence.
