When I joined the Winter Internship by IIT Ropar in collaboration with NPTEL, Vicharanshala, and DLED Labs, I was excited… and honestly, a little scared.

This was my first-ever internship, and I had zero prior experience with technologies like JavaScript, React, or MongoDB. In the beginning, everything felt overwhelming. New terms, new tools, new expectations — there were days when I wondered if I was really capable of keeping up.

I had to put in extra effort just to understand the basics. I needed guidance, reassurance, and sometimes a push to not give up. The ViBe learning platform, with its AI-based proctoring, helped me stay focused on days when my mind wanted to wander. It quietly built discipline — something I didn’t realize.

Being part of this internship under Prof. Sudarshan Iyenger sir has been a truly meaningful experience. Sir has a unique way of teaching — turning complex concepts into something approachable through a gamified and concept-first approach. One thing he often said that really stayed with me was “The strength of weak ties.” It changed the way I look at connections, communication, and learning from people around me.

Two weeks into the internship, I could already feel a shift — not just technically, but mentally.

There were moments when I compared my progress with others. Some completed modules in just two days, and that put a lot of pressure on me. I felt slow. I felt behind. But the stand-up sessions with Prof and the team helped me understand something important — it’s okay to go slow, as long as you don’t stop. What matters is what you’re learning, not how fast you finish.

That mindset shift changed everything .Instead of rushing, I focused on understanding. I started revisiting concepts, tracking my daily progress, and showing up consistently.Slowly, this routine built something deeper than technical skills: patience, confidence, and self-belief.

Yes, I am learning the MERN stack — but more than that, I feel like I am building myself.I’m improving my communication skills, making meaningful connections, and learning how to stay consistent even when things feel difficult.

What makes this internship special is that it doesn’t feel like something to “just complete.” It feels like a safe, guided space for growth and an environment that allows us to grow at our own pace without feeling judged.

As I continue this journey, I’m looking forward to learning more, building more, and carrying these lessons into my future — both academically and professionally.

Grateful. Learning. Growing. 🌱
