Getting into the Pinternship at VLED Labs became a turning point. The learning approach was very different short explanations followed by frequent questions forced me to pause and think instead of just watching content. If I didn’t understand something, it became obvious immediately, and going back to relearn slowly improved my clarity.

The live discussions made the experience feel collaborative. Hearing others talk about their doubts reminded me that learning is a shared process. Case studies pushed me to reason through problems rather than memorize steps, and even reporting platform issues made me feel involved rather than just consuming content.

Over time I noticed a change: I wasn’t trying to remember code anymore I was trying to understand it.

This internship didn’t magically fix everything, but it gave me proof that consistent effort with the right learning method actually leads to growth.

Grateful to VLED Labs, Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, Sudarshan Iyengar, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar and NPTEL for the learning experience.
