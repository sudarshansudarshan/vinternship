I didn’t feel confident when this internship began. I felt lost. I didn’t know why.

I entered this internship with a lack of self confidence and confusion. Since I am from a non-coding background and had no prior knowledge of MERN stack development, it made me feel insecure.

Taking an internship part time is highly challenging and hectic. I needed to manage my regular academics, projects, and assignments. Also, my two internal exams fell in between these 10 weeks of internship.

When it comes to the internship, one should attend standup sessions, live sessions, follow weekly goals, complete the VIBe course and case study, and apart from this, I needed to practice a lot to withstand among my intelligent peers!

I paused for a moment, and something shifted when I truly understood the meaning of a quote that I personally love: “MY DREAM PERSON IS ME AT MY FULL POTENTIAL.”

I learned how to learn better and became a better person.Stepping out of comfort zone and the ability to work under pressure can unlock a person’s full potential.

The best part of this journey is learning how to learn. I started practicing small codes along with understanding concepts. I set a goal for each day and perfectly managed my academics along with this internship.

I always made sure to ask myself these questions before sleeping: 

“What am I doing?”  
“What am I supposed to do?”  
“Do I really understand the concept?”  
“How can I make it easier?”  
“Did I learn something new today from this internship?”

Through this, I started asking better questions.

Breakout sessions had a huge contribution to my learning. Without any hesitation, I interacted with my peers, and they helped me a lot.

One of the best decisions in my life was taking up this internship. It not only taught me how to code but also made me more confident, better at time management, and a better person. It was a great opportunity to explore my potential.

I am grateful to the mentors and my peers for creating an environment that encouraged thinking, reflection, and growth. What once made me feel lost eventually helped me find direction.

Feeling lost wasn’t a mistake. Staying lost is.
