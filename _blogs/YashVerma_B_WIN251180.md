I am excited to share my internship experience so far at IIT Ropar under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar . This internship is very different from the other internships I have experienced. Earlier, I used to skip things easily, but here I learned how to be consistent and dedicated.

I learned the MERN stack on the ViBe platform, where AI proctoring pushed me to stay focused and disciplined. Because of this, I couldn’t lose focus, and I completed 75% of my ViBe progress in just 3 weeks. The learning was concept-based, and after each topic, quizzes helped test whether I had truly understood the concepts.

Along with this, I also worked on case studies. So far, I have completed 3 TypeScript case studies by discussing and collaborating with my peers in breakout sessions. These discussions helped me understand different perspectives and learn better.

One quote shared by Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar during our stand-up really stayed with me: “Our network is our net worth.” Through this internship, I have made many valuable connections.

Overall, these three weeks of the internship have been highly productive and enriching.

I am truly grateful to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir for his guidance and support, and to the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar for providing such a wonderful learning platform. I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks of this internship and I am excited to continue learning, exploring, and improving myself further.
