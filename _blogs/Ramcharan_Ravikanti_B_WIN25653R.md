Title: "Learning at My Own Pace"

When I joined the Vinternship, I honestly had no idea what the MERN stack even meant. I had heard the term before, but that was it. So when the course started on ViBe, everything felt new and slightly scary.

In the first few days, I kept comparing myself with others. Some people were completing modules quickly. Some were asking advanced doubts. I was still trying to understand basic things properly. I won’t lie — that affected my confidence.

There were moments during case studies where I just stared at the screen. The logic wasn’t coming. I felt stuck. I even wondered if maybe this field was not for me.

But instead of quitting or rushing through, I decided to slow down.

I started revisiting concepts. I rewrote code again and again until I understood why it worked. Sometimes progress was very small. But it was real.

Breakout room discussions helped me realize something important — everyone struggles. We just don’t always talk about it openly. Preparing for the viva also made me reflect on whether I truly understood the concepts or was just memorizing them.

This internship didn’t suddenly make me an expert developer. But it changed my mindset.

Now when I don’t understand something, I don’t panic immediately. I give myself time. I try again. I ask questions. I don’t measure my progress only by speed anymore.

If I had to describe this journey in one sentence, I would say this: I learned how to stay consistent even when I felt behind.

And for me, that lesson is bigger than any technology I learned here.
