# something New - Pinternship

    Rome Wasn’t Built in One Day , Neither Was ViBe

When I joined the Pinternship program, they introduced us to the ViBe platform.

Not gonna lie , my first impression was rough.

The platform felt slow. The website felt massive. And the documentation… honestly, it felt like reading a legal contract.

I remember thinking: "This is going to be hard to follow."

But then something unexpected happened.

the team actually listened.

They improved the speed. They optimized the platform. They introduced dashboards that made the stats like HP much more understandable and they even built a chatbot to make documentation easier to navigate.

What mattered wasn’t that the platform started imperfect. What mattered was that it kept evolving because the people behind it cared enough to improve it.

even i shared few bugs which addressed soon by the team

    The Strength of Weak Ties

Sudarshan Iyengar sir talked about the strength of weak ties.

Seriously, many people don’t understand how powerful weak ties are. Most of the opportunities I discovered in my life came through weak ties, not close connections.

What I liked about this internship is that they created so many chances to build weak ties like standups, breakout rooms, and weekly sessions. Because of that, we got to connect with different people regularly.

The work the team is doing is impressive, and I’m looking forward to learning more from them.
