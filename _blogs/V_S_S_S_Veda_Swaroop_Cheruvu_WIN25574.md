When I enrolled for the MERN stack internship by VLED Labs in collaboration with IIT Ropar, I assumed it would comfortably fit around my existing routine. Since it was an online internship, I expected it to be manageable along with my academic responsibilities and exam preparation. Based on prior experiences with virtual internships, I thought it would involve consuming course material, completing assessments, and earning a certificate. I did not expect it to demand sustained attention or challenge how I approach learning.

That assumption was shattered early on. The internship was far more structured than I had though. Regular standups, meetings gave it a rhythm that felt similar to a professional corporate environment than a typical online program. Breakout rooms during Zoom sessions encouraged interaction and networking, making it obvious that active participation gives the complete experience of this internship. Sadly till now I did not network as actively as I could have, due to time constraints.

This internship coincided with the most hectic phase of my life(my last year of college). I was juggling interviews, exam prep, college deadlines, and other commitments. As a result, there were times when I was more observant than participative. I attended sessions and followed discussions, but did not always engage actively. This was not due to a lack of interest, but rather the challenge of managing limited time and energy across multiple priorities.

What stayed with me during this period was the experience of continuing despite friction. Issues like slow website loads, Face not detected anomalies, along with exciting opportunities such as hackathons clashing with academic deadlines, often saddened me. However, much like the ViBe team’s emphasis on iteration and improvement, I found myself reflecting on my own approach and pushing forward despite these setbacks.

Certain conversations during meetings, particularly quotes and insights shared by Sudarshan Iyengar sir, prompted me to reflect on why I learn. It isn't always about the tools or accessories but the essense of thought,approach and action that persists as wisdom.

Another unexpected shift was my experience with frontend development. I had previously found it overwhelming and disengaging, leading me to avoid it altogether. However, the linear and structured progression of this internship offered me a challenging re-entry and I accepted the challenge. Learning React felt challenging, but not chaotic, and that made engagement possible.

Although the internship is still ongoing, it has already changed how I approach learning and time management. What remains with me is not just technical exposure, but a meaningful learning experience.
