Joining the Vinternship through ViBe introduced me to a very different way of learning full-stack development. Instead of passive lessons, the MERN stack course was completely hands-on, which meant understanding concepts by actually building and debugging.

Working through MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js made me realise how important fundamentals and consistency are. Some concepts clicked quickly, while others required revisiting, experimenting, and breaking things before they made sense. That process itself became a key part of learning.

The case studies pushed me to think beyond syntax and focus on problem-solving—how to approach a requirement, reason through edge cases, and improve solutions iteratively. It felt less like completing tasks and more like learning how developers actually think.

Mentorship played an important role in this journey. Clear explanations and timely feedback helped me correct mistakes early and understand not just what to do, but why something works a certain way.

This Vinternship is still ongoing, but it has already helped me build a stronger technical foundation and a more disciplined approach to learning. More than tools or frameworks, I’m taking away the habit of learning patiently and applying concepts through practice.
