Landing my first internship at IIT Ropar under guidance of Sudarshan Iyengar was a thrilling milestone for me. Even within the first couple of weeks, I can already see how this opportunity is shaping me both technically and personally.

The atmosphere here is interactive and discussion-driven, which encouraged me to step beyond my usual comfort zone. We have Standup sessions, Daily group talks and breakout activities helped me build confidence in expressing my ideas openly.

Our journey began with practical exposure to the MERN stack on the ViBe platform, paired with case studies that spark critical analysis

More recently, we registered for a two-phase hackathon, which has been an exciting chance to apply our skills, work collaboratively, and explore creative solutions

The guidance from faculty and the support of fellow interns have made this experience both motivating and enjoyable. With several weeks still ahead, I look forward to deepening my knowledge, refining my skills, and continuing to grow through this internship.

Feeling grateful for the learning and growth this journey is bringing.

Thank you!!!
