Two weeks into my NPTEL Winter Internship at IIT Ropar, and this journey has already changed the way I approach learning.

The beginning wasn’t easy. New tools, new structure, and the ViBe platform felt unfamiliar at first. There were moments of doubt, but with time, patience, and guidance, those doubts slowly turned into understanding.

Learning the MERN stack through ViBe has been both challenging and engaging. Short videos followed by quizzes demanded focus and consistency, teaching me that real progress comes from discipline rather than speed.

The daily stand-up sessions became an important part of the experience. They weren’t just updates—they were moments of reflection, motivation, and shared learning. Listening to Sudarshan Sir and interacting with peers helped me stay grounded and focused.

The breakout sessions and case discussions were another highlight. Collaborating with students from diverse backgrounds showed me how much stronger learning becomes when ideas are shared and perspectives differ.

In just two weeks, I’ve already learned lessons that go beyond technical skills—punctuality, accountability, and staying committed even when things feel challenging.

Grateful to NPTEL, IIT Ropar, Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, ANNAM.AI and all the mentors for making this learning journey meaningful.

Excited for what lies ahead.
