This Vinternship was different from what I was used to, mainly in how learning happened.

Most of the time, I was responsible for deciding when to pause, revise, or move ahead. That sounds simple, but it wasn’t. When I didn’t spend enough time on a concept, it showed up later during case studies.

While solving those problems, I often had to revisit earlier topics. Sometimes I understood them better the second time than the first. That made me realise that learning didn’t always happen in one go.

Using ViBe consistently mattered more than I expected. On days when I followed the sessions properly, I felt more confident while solving problems. On days when I didn’t, I struggled more.

Group discussions helped me understand that everyone was facing different difficulties. Some people struggled with concepts I found easier, and some found clarity where I didn’t. That made the learning environment feel normal, not competitive.

This opportunity helped me understand what matters is that I need to check if I learned something, it was not if I just finished my task.

This Vinternship didn’t change what I want to learn.

It changed how I approach learning.
