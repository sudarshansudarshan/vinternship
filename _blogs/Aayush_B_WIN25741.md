Grateful to have been part of the NPTEL Internship in collaboration with IIT Ropar, an experience that quietly reshaped how I approach learning and growth.

What stood out from the beginning was the learning structure. Instead of passive lectures or rushing through content, the internship emphasized active engagement and consistency. while working through MERN Stack fundamentals Progress depended on understanding concepts deeply rather than simply moving ahead.

Another fascinating part of this experience was watching the learning platform develop in real time. The initial performance problems were resolved rapidly through feedback, providing a valuable insight into how real-world products develop through collaboration.

As the internship progressed, case studies brought an element of uncertainty and real-world constraints, encouraging me to look beyond coding and focus on design choices. The stand-ups and group interactions also provided a collaborative environment that helped improve my communication and technical skills.

Moving forward, as I enter the project phase, I look forward to applying these insights in a more applied manner.

Thankful to IIT Ropar, NPTEL, VLED Labs, Sudarshan Iyengar, Harshdeep R., ANNAM.AI, and the ViBe team, and all the mentors for creating an experience that emphasizes thoughtful learning over rapid pace.
