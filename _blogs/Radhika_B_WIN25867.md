What I thought before joining the internship.
       I was very excited before starting the internship because it was my first time entering professional life. I thought the internship would be easy to complete.

3 Weeks Experience in the Winter Internship at IIT Ropar.

My first day of the internship was filled with excitement. I was curious about how the internship would go. However,during the first stand-up session, I realized that completing this internship would not be easy. It would require a lot of hard work and consistency. Because we had to turn on our camera and submit video responses during the stand-ups, I felt a little bit of uncomfortable in the beginning. But later,I understood that turning on the camera actually helps us stay engaged and build better connections during the internship meetings.

the next day, I started the ViBe course,which includes MERN stack learning through the VLED lab. In the beginning,I felt that i might not be able to do it because of the AI detection and the frequent quizzes every minute.Later,I slowly improved my learning skills,listening skills,understanding ability,and consistency all increased with time.

After two weeks,I started solving the case studies.Solvig them didn't feel too difficult because the VLED lab had already strengthened my understanding of MERN stack concepts and provided hands-on experience.
