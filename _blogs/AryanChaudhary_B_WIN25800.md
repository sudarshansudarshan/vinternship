Warm greetings to everyone reading this.

I’m writing this blog not as a conclusion, but as a pause in the middle of my journey through the Pinternship. It’s a snapshot of where my mind is right now—still learning, still unsure in places, still growing.

When I first joined, I knew it would be competitive. I told myself I was ready for that. But knowing something intellectually and experiencing it are very different things.

The first real jolt came when I saw my name on the leaaderboard.

Something shifted instantly. I started paying attention to details I might have ignored earlier—every score, every checkpoint, every small mistake. Competition has a way of revealing parts of yourself you didn’t know were there. For me, it revealed how deeply I care once I commit to something.

Being a first-year among people who are mostly in their third or fourth year was intimidating. Almost everyone around me is an NPTEL topper, and I could clearly feel the gap in experience. The milestones, the penalties, the rules—they all felt heavy at first. There were moments when I genuinely wondered if I would be able to keep up, or if I’d end up crossing a line I didn’t even see coming.

So far, I haven’t—and that itself feels like a quiet personal victory.

Not everything felt smooth or ideal. Early on, when AI proctoring wasn’t fully active, it was hard not to notice that some people were taking advantage of that gap. Initially, it frustrated me. I had entered this internship expecting a fair and honest challenge, and seeing loopholes being exploited felt discouraging.

But that frustration eventually taught me something important.

Real systems are imperfect. Real people make different choices. And in the long run, the only thing I truly control is my own integrity and own effort. Once I accepted that, I stopped wasting energy on comparison and redirected it toward my own learning.

The case studies have been one of the most defining parts of this experience so far. They didn’t just test whether I watched the ViBe videos—they tested whether I could think. Many problems pushed me beyond familiar territory. Even something as basic as properly setting up Visual Studio Code revealed gaps in my understanding that I didn’t know existed.

ViBe hadn’t taught me every detail—and that’s the point.

I had to search, experiment, fail, and try again. That struggle marked a shift for me. I stopped feeling like someone who was just “doing a course” and started feeling—slowly—like someone learning how developers actually work.

The role of the VLED Labs faculty in this journey cannot be overstated. Whether it’s Rohit Sharma Sir, Sakshi Sharma Ma’am, or Meenakshi V Ma’am, there’s a rare balance they maintain: professionalism without distance, guidance without spoon-feeding. You can feel that they care not just about outputs, but about how your thinking evolves.

Because of that environment, something strange has happened. If I don’t watch ViBe on a given day, I feel unsettled—almost like I’ve skipped something essential. Learning has started to feel like a routine rather than a task.

That said, I’m very aware that my consistency still isn’t where I want it to be. I’m not “there” yet. But this Pinternship has done something crucial—it has made me believe that getting there is possible, provided I keep showing up.

Another unexpected highlight has been the network I’ve begun to build. In just a couple of weeks, my LinkedIn connections jumped from 14 to over 100. But these aren’t just numbers. Each connection represents someone who is also navigating confusion, curiosity, effort, and ambition.

It feels like I’ve been placed inside a community where taking learning seriously is normal—and that’s incredibly motivating.

Above all, I feel deeply grateful for the opportunity to intern under Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and to be part of this ecosystem. Even though I’m still in the middle of this journey, I already know that it’s shaping how I think about learning, competition, and growth.

To anyone from a future cohort who might read this: don’t see this as just another internship or a line on your CV. If you let it, this experience will challenge your assumptions, test your discipline, and teach you things that go far beyond technical skills.

And honestly—that’s something to be proud of, even before the journey ends.

I thank Sudarshan Iyengar Sir for this amazing opportunity.
