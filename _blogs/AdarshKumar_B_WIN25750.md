As a child, one of my favorite cartoons was Vikram Betal. I still remember sitting in front of the TV, watching King Vikram carry Betal on his shoulders through the dark forest. Every episode followed the same pattern—Betal would tell a story, ask a question, and challenge Vikram’s wisdom. If Vikram knew the answer and spoke, Betal would fly back to the tree, and the journey would begin again.

At that time, it was just a cartoon. A mysterious forest, a clever ghost, and a king who never gave up. But years later, during my Vinternship with VLED Lab, I realized something surprising. The platform where I was learning the MERN stack was called ViBe—short for Vikram Betal. And suddenly, that childhood memory started to feel very real again.

This time, I was the one walking through the forest.

When I began the internship, everything felt unfamiliar. New technologies, new concepts, and a completely different way of learning. There were moments when I felt confident, but there were also many moments when I felt lost. Just like Vikram carrying Betal, every time I thought I understood something, a new challenge appeared.

The MERN stack sessions on ViBe were not just about watching and memorizing. They were about trying, failing, and trying again. Sometimes the errors made no sense. Sometimes the logic felt confusing. But the journey never stopped. Each day felt like another question from Betal—another puzzle that demanded patience and clarity.

Working on the case studies became an important part of this journey. They gave me the opportunity to apply what I had learned and think more deeply about real-world problems. Each case study pushed me to connect concepts, write better logic, and approach problems with more patience and focus. Over time, I started noticing improvements in the way I structured my solutions and understood different parts of the stack.

Over time, consistency started to make a difference. Even on days when progress felt slow, showing up and continuing the journey helped me build confidence. Small concepts began to connect, and problems that once felt difficult slowly became manageable.

Now, as I complete the first half of this internship, I can clearly see the change in my mindset. It is not just about learning technologies anymore. It is about developing patience, problem-solving ability, and the confidence to face challenges without giving up.

What stayed with me the most was not just the technical knowledge. It was the feeling of persistence. In the cartoon, Vikram never dropped Betal, no matter how many times the journey restarted. And in a way, this internship has taught me the same lesson—real growth comes from continuing, even when the path feels uncertain.

It’s strange how something from childhood can return years later in a completely different form. What once was just a cartoon became a quiet metaphor for my learning journey.

From watching Vikram Betal as a child to learning on ViBe as an intern, it feels like the story is still unfolding.

And just like Vikram, I’m ready for the next question, the next challenge, and the next step in the journey.

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to the entire VLED Labs team for designing such a thoughtful and growth-oriented internship experience. A special thanks to Sudarshan Iyengar sir for the guidance, feedback, and encouragement throughout this journey. Your support made this learning experience more meaningful and impactful.
