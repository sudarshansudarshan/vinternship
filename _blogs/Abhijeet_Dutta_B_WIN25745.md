This journey didn’t teach me everything—but it taught me how to learn without running away from discomfort.

When I first joined the Pinternship with VLED Lab, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. I was genuinely happy to be selected from students all over India, especially knowing that only a few were chosen. At the same time, the fact that this opportunity came from IIT Ropar made me anxious. I wasn’t sure what to expect or whether I would be able to match the level that was expected of me.

The journey did not start smoothly.

My first moment of discomfort came while attending classes on the ViBe platform. In the beginning, the platform was laggy and full of bugs—videos didn’t load properly, quizzes wouldn’t appear correctly, and the rules felt very strict. It was frustrating and, honestly, discouraging at first. However, what stood out was how actively the team worked on these issues. Within a few days, most of the problems were fixed, and the learning experience became much smoother. Once that happened, I was able to fully focus on learning—and eventually, I completed the ViBe course at #4 on the leaderboard, which was a proud moment for me.

Learning on ViBe felt very different from what I was used to.

Instead of long lectures, we were shown short 1–2 minute videos followed immediately by quizzes. Initially, I found the quizzes irritating. They felt like pressure. But over time, I realized their real purpose—they forced me to pay close attention and truly understand what was being taught. I couldn’t just “watch and move on.” This method helped me gain deeper clarity and made my learning more active than passive.

Case studies played an important role in this journey.

At first, TypeScript felt easy, but as the concepts became more complex, I started facing difficulties. There were moments when I was stuck and needed help from my peers. But one moment that stayed with me was when I managed to solve a case study without any help. That small success gave me confidence. More than syntax, the case studies helped me understand where and how these concepts are applied in real-life scenarios. I have always been curious about how companies work internally—what concepts are used, where, and why. These case studies helped bridge that gap between theory and reality.

Interaction with others was another meaningful part of the experience.

Through breakout rooms and discussions, I connected with many peers, made good friends, and collaborated while solving problems. These interactions not only improved my understanding but also helped me expand my LinkedIn network. Learning alongside others made the journey less isolating and more motivating.

The fact that this internship is associated with IIT Ropar initially made me nervous, but over time, that fear turned into confidence. I started feeling more capable than before. The support from Sudarshan Iyengar , VLED Labs , ANNAM.AI , Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design and the whole team played a big role in this. They clearly understood the common doubts students might have, which were already addressed in the FAQs. The introduction of a chatbot was especially helpful—it saved time and made resolving doubts easier without searching through long documents.

One important realization from this Pinternship is that learning is not about consuming content—it’s about engaging with it consistently and honestly. This internship is still ongoing, but it has already changed how I look at learning, problem-solving, and self-discipline.

This journey hasn’t made me perfect, but it has made me more confident, more aware of my gaps, and more comfortable with learning through challenges. And that, for me, is real progress.
