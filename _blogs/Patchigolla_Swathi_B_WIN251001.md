This article is about my learning experience so far during my internship at IIT Ropar. The internship focuses on MERN Stack development, which is completely new to me. In the beginning, I felt quite overwhelmed seeing the structure, rules, tasks, and milestones. However, as I started learning, I understood that it is not meant to create pressure, but to help us stay consistent and build a strong learning routine.

The ViBe platform has been extremely helpful in this journey. The short videos followed by quizzes make the learning process more interactive and help me check how well I have understood each topic. The progress tracking and leaderboard also motivate us to keep improving and stay engaged along with our peers.

The stand-up sessions and breakout rooms have played an important role in my growth as well. During stand-up sessions, we share our progress and learning experiences, which has helped improve communication skills and build confidence. In breakout rooms, we discuss doubts, exchange ideas, and solve problems together. Instead of learning alone, we grow as a team.

This experience has shown me that teamwork, collaboration, and communication are just as important as technical knowledge. I’m looking forward to the coming weeks, continuing to learn, and making the most of this opportunity.

I am truly grateful to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, NPTEL , ANNAM.AI and Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design for creating such a supportive and structured learning environment. Thank you for your constant guidance and encouragement.
