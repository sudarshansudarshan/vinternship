Sometimes opportunities don’t arrive with announcements.

They arrive quietly — hidden in your inbox.

On 12th January 2026 at 1:14 PM, I received an email about the NPTEL Winter Internship offered under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar . At first glance, I ignored it. Honestly, I thought it was just another spam mail.

To be sure, I messaged one of my classmates and asked whether she had received the same email. Her reply shocked me:

“Yes, I’ve already applied. Today is the last date — till 5 PM.”

Suddenly, everything felt urgent.

Since I had scored 95% in “The Joy of Computing Using Python” and ranked among the Top 5%, I was eligible. I immediately checked my Gmail again — and to my surprise, I found that the same email had actually arrived three days earlier. I had simply missed it.

Now I had only three hours left.

The biggest challenge?

I needed a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from my college within those three hours.

Without wasting a moment, I went to my HOD Raju Kumar sir. Despite the short notice, he supported me wholeheartedly. With his help, I managed to complete all formalities and finally submitted my application at around 4:30 PM — just minutes before the deadline.

A few days later, I received the confirmation email.

I was happy.

But I was also nervous.

This was my first internship. My mind was full of doubts:

What if I can’t keep up?

What if everyone else is better than me?

What if I make mistakes?

But the first stand-up session changed everything.

Instead of pressure, I found clarity.

Instead of fear, I found guidance.

Instead of competition, I found a learning environment.

I realized that we wouldn’t be rushed into projects. Instead, we would be trained, guided, and prepared step by step. The clarity, structure, and positivity from the mentors—especially Sudarshan Iyengar Jinal Gupta Meenakshi V Rohit Sharma Harshdeep R. Sakshi Sharma Nitin Sankar and the entire team—created an environment where learning felt safe and exciting. Slowly, my hesitation turned into confidence, and my curiosity into consistency.

I was also fortunate to receive support from seniors Himanshu P Dev , PRATHEEK G , JAISREE RAGAVI J Tanvi Nagrare from previous cohorts. Their notes, explanations, and encouragement helped me understand concepts more clearly and made the journey smoother than I expected.

Now, 2 weeks into the internship, I can confidently say that the journey has been smoother and more enriching than I had imagined. I have completed the first phase, moved into case studies, and explored new concepts without fear or pressure. Beyond technical learning, I’ve gained confidence, clarity, and a new way of thinking.

With several weeks still ahead, I am excited about what lies next—the challenges, the learning, and the growth.

This journey has taught me an important lesson: when the right opportunity meets the right timing, everything starts to align.

Grateful for the journey so far. Excited for what’s yet to come ✨
