This was my first internship, and also my first experience with a virtual internship. In the beginning, I felt a mix of excitement and uncertainty. Although we had face-to-face interactions through Zoom, it didn’t feel the same as sitting in a classroom. At times, I worried that I might miss important details or struggle to keep up with the pace. At the same time, there was a quiet excitement in trying something new.

Over time, my perspective changed. I realized that learning depended less on physical presence and more on consistency, attention, and active participation. This understanding reshaped how I viewed learning and responsibility in a virtual internship.

Many internships feel like brief academic courses—concepts are taught, assignments are given, and a certificate follows. While this builds knowledge, it often lacks a sense of real responsibility and an industry mindset. At IIT Ropar, the experience feels different. Learning here demands self-discipline, curiosity, and personal accountability. It pushes me to take charge of my own growth, focusing on truly understanding and applying what I learn rather than just completing tasks.

The Internship Structure
The internship has three main parts:

VIBE – Learn MERN stack through short videos and quizzes.
Case Studies – Solve real-life problems using what we learn.
Projects – Work on projects to practice skills and teamwork

Learning MERN Through VIBE and Case Studies
The first week is all about getting familiar with VIBE, the platform guiding our MERN stack learning. At first, it feels a bit overwhelming, but I soon see how unique it is. Each concept comes in short videos, followed by a quiz. If I answer incorrectly, I go back and watch the concept again. I can’t move forward until I truly understand it. Even the concepts that seemed complicated at first started to click with repetition and focus. It wasn’t just about completing videos; it was about truly understanding each idea.

By the end of the first week, I had completed 100% of the MERN content on VIBE. I already knew some front-end, so learning the full stack helped me see how it all connects. Now, I’m applying what I’ve learned to real-world case studies, implementing the concepts taught in class by Nandan Prabhudesai sir.

Breakout Sessions

The best part of the internship is the breakout sessions, where we discuss concepts, solve problems given in Case Studies, and learn from each other. We don’t just copy answers—we try to understand, apply, and explain concepts in our own way. This makes the sessions interesting and helps us learn and grow.

I am deeply grateful to NPTEL, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , especially Sudarshan Iyengar , for creating this valuable learning opportunity. I also appreciate the constant support and guidance from Nitin Sankar sir, Meenakshi V ma’am, Rohit Sharma sir, Jinal Gupta ma’am, Harshdeep R. ma’am, Sakshi Sharma ma’am , and Nandan Prabhudesai sir, whose encouragement makes this journey inspiring and impactful.

These first two weeks have been an incredible journey of learning and growth. I feel grateful, inspired, and excited to see how much more I will learn and grow in the rest of this 10-week journey.
