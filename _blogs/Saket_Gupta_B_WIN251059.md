title: "This Journey Did Not Make Things Easier. It Made Me Stronger"

There is a proverb that says, *“Smooth seas never made a skilled sailor.”* I did not understand its weight until this journey began.

I started the ViBe course on **15th January** with excitement, but that excitement was quickly tested by reality. Being a third year engineering student, my plate was already full. Placement preparation, core domain subjects, deadlines and constant pressure to perform were all competing for my time. Adding this internship to the mix felt overwhelming almost immediately.

There were nights when I genuinely questioned my decision.

Watching videos, especially when they are short and numerous, can feel mechanical unless there is immediate application. The ViBe platform required patience. There were many two‑minute videos, one after another, and at times it felt exhausting rather than engaging. Somewhere in the middle of that struggle, a thought crossed my mind very clearly — *maybe this internship is not meant for me. Maybe I should let it go.*

That night was important.

Because the next day, something changed. I reminded myself of another old saying, *“A person who wants two harvests must learn to till two fields.”* Growth does not come from choosing comfort. It comes from choosing responsibility. I realised that if I truly wanted to become capable, I had to stop running away from discomfort.

So I stayed.

I decided to push myself beyond the illusion of comfort I was living in. I chose consistency over convenience. For more than a week, I consciously put my domain subjects on pause and committed myself fully to the ViBe course. It was not easy. There were moments in the middle where quitting felt like relief. But discipline quietly replaced motivation.

Day by day, video by video, quiz by quiz, I kept moving.

On **29th January 2026**, I completed the ViBe course with **100 percent completion**. That moment felt deeply satisfying. Not because it was just another course completed, but because I proved something to myself. I proved that I can stay consistent even when things feel misaligned. I proved that I can finish what I start, even when doubt is loud.

> Confidence does not arrive loudly. It grows silently.

This journey pushed me out of comfort and into character. It taught me that learning is not always exciting, but it is always rewarding when done honestly. It taught me that discipline is more reliable than motivation. Most importantly, it reminded me that progress often begins exactly where the mind wants to quit.

Now, as I move forward into the next phase of this internship and begin solving case studies, I feel prepared not just academically, but mentally. I am more comfortable with challenge. More patient with the process. More confident in my ability to learn under pressure.

I am grateful for the ecosystem that made this experience possible — the guidance and vision of **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar**, the initiative and association with **Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar**, the efforts of **VLED Labs**, and the thoughtful design by **Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design**. Together, they have created a learning environment that does not spoon‑feed, but shapes thinkers.

This journey is still unfolding. But if there is one thing it has already given me, it is belief.

Belief that I can stand steady when learning gets uncomfortable.

And that, for me, is real growth.
