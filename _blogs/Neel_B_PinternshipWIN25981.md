Before my internship at IIT Ropar, I had no experience with the MERN stack at all. I had only heard about it and done a few small frontend projects. To be very honest, MERN stack always looked like something everyone else was doing. Slowly it started feeling like people were just running behind it because others were doing the same. That is why I felt it was a rat race and decided that MERN stack was probably not for me. Instead of learning it deeply, I focused more on core Computer Science subjects like OS, DBMS and DSA. I spent most of my time understanding these subjects and their concepts. I always believed that strong fundamentals are very important and they help you for a long time in your career.

When I joined my internship at IIT Ropar and came to know that it was based on MERN stack, I was honestly not very confident. I had many doubts in my mind and I was not sure whether this internship was right for me or not. But things started changing from the very first live class. Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar explained something very simple but very meaningful. He said that no matter what project you work on, you need two things. One is web development, where MERN stack is useful, and the other is app development using Flutter or similar tools. He explained that every project needs an interface and it does not make sense to show your work only on a terminal. This thought really stayed with me and slowly changed the way I looked at MERN stack. He also said one line that I remember clearly, your network is your net worth. He said this while asking us to be more active on LinkedIn. It was a simple line but it made a lot of sense to me. After that class, I started thinking more about MERN stack and also about learning app development in the future.

At the beginning, I thought this internship at IIT Ropar would be like my previous internships. In those internships, we were just given tasks and deadlines and we had to figure everything on our own. In my earlier internships, I struggled a lot because I did not fully understand the tech stack, and when tasks came, I felt stuck many times. This internship was different. The biggest difference was the training phase. Before giving us actual work, they focused on teaching everything properly. This helped me a lot because I could clear my basics and understand why things work, instead of just writing code without knowing the reason.

The training at IIT Ropar was very well planned. It was divided into three parts. In the first part, we learned through videos on the ViBe platform. ViBe was interesting because it checked audio, video and surroundings, which helped me stay focused. There were also case studies, which made learning feel more real. One thing I really liked was the health points system. Health points worked like money. If you did things properly, you gained points, and if you were careless, you lost them. Some sessions needed health points, so I started trying to earn more of them. Without even realizing it, I became more regular and serious about learning. After the training, we started working on small projects. These projects helped me gain confidence and practical experience, and I could also add them to my resume. Later, we moved to actual internship tasks, where learning became more hands on.

Another good part of this internship at IIT Ropar was the Ajrasakha Hackathon, which was conducted every month. It helped me understand how hackathons actually work and how to think beyond just writing code. Slowly, I realized that this internship was not just about tasks. It was a full learning experience with training sessions, live classes, hackathons and expert talks. We even had a session by Dr. Chris Dede, who is a professor at Harvard. I never expected something like this in an internship. That session made me realize that learning is not only about coding, there is much more to it.

The professors at IIT Ropar were very supportive throughout the internship. Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar is very approachable and kind. He also runs a club called Coder’s High. I messaged him on LinkedIn about the club, and he replied very quickly and encouraged me, even when I felt I might not fit in. He explains things in a very clear and simple way. As a student, we often get confused because there is too much advice everywhere, but his guidance makes things easier to understand. This internship was very special for me because it was my first internship connected with IIT Ropar. Coming from a Tier 2 college, I was nervous in the beginning and had a lot of self doubt. But slowly, I started feeling more confident because the environment focused more on learning and growth, not pressure.

This internship taught me something important. Sometimes, the thing we avoid the most is actually what we need to learn. With the right guidance, even a technology you did not like before can start making sense. I am still learning and still making mistakes, but I know I am growing. This journey at IIT Ropar really means a lot to me.
