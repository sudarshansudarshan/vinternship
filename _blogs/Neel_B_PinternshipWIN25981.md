# From Skepticism to Confidence

Before my internship at **IIT Ropar**, I honestly did not have much experience with **MERN Stack**.  
I had built a few frontend projects, but MERN stack always felt like something everyone was doing. It felt like a rat race to me. Because of that, I had already made up my mind that MERN Stack was probably not for me.

So instead of going deep into it, I focused more on core **Computer Science concepts** like OS, DBMS, DSA. I believed that strong fundamentals mattered more.

## The first shift in mindset

So when I joined the internship at **IIT Ropar** and realized that it was based on MERN stack, I was quite skeptical. I was not very confident on the first day.

But that changed during the first live class at IIT Ropar.

**Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar** explained something very simple but very impactful. He said that no matter what project you work on, you need two basic things.  
One is web development using MERN stack.  
The other is app development using Flutter or similar technologies.

Because at the end of the day, every project needs an interface. You cannot really present your work only through a terminal.

That idea stayed with me and slowly changed how I looked at MERN stack.

> **"Your network is your net-worth"**  
> *Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar*

This was something he shared while encouraging us to be more active on LinkedIn, and it genuinely stuck with me.

## Why this internship at IIT Ropar felt different

Initially, I thought this internship at IIT Ropar would be like most internships.  
Tasks, deadlines, and figuring things out on your own.

I have done two internships before, and in both of them I struggled a lot in the beginning because I did not have complete knowledge of the tech stack. When real tasks came, I felt stuck.

But this internship at **IIT Ropar** was very different.

The biggest plus point was the **training phase**.

Before jumping into real work, the focus was on learning and understanding everything properly. That helped me a lot. I could clear my basics and actually understand what I was doing instead of just writing code without clarity.

## Training structure at IIT Ropar

The training at IIT Ropar was divided into **three phases**.

**Phase one** focused on learning through videos on the **ViBe platform**.  
The platform itself was quite surprising.

- AI based proctoring  
- Monitoring audio, video, and surroundings  
- Ensuring focus during learning  

Along with that, there were **case studies** to solve, which made learning more practical.

## The health points system

One thing that really stood out during the IIT Ropar training was the **health points system**.

Health points worked like a currency.  
You could earn them by doing things right and lose them if you were careless.

Some privileges like special sessions required health points. Honestly, I started chasing them. And without realizing it, I was learning more consistently. That system worked really well for me.

## Projects and real work

After the training phase at IIT Ropar, we moved to the **project phase**.

First, we were given basic projects so that we could apply what we learned.  
These projects helped in

- building confidence  
- gaining practical experience  
- adding meaningful work to the resume  

After that, we moved to actual internship tasks, where the learning became more real.

## Hackathons and expert exposure

Another surprising part of this internship at **IIT Ropar** was the **Ajrasakha Hackathon**, which was conducted every month.

This gave real exposure to

- how hackathons work  
- how to participate effectively  
- how to think beyond just writing code  

This internship at IIT Ropar was not just about tasks. It felt like a **complete learning package**.

Training sessions, live classes, hackathons, standards, and expert lectures were all part of it.

We also had an expert session by **Dr. Chris Dede**, who is a professor and educator at **Harvard**.  
Getting exposure to such sessions during an internship at IIT Ropar was something I did not expect at all. It really broadened my perspective and showed how much learning goes beyond just coding.

## Support and mentorship

The professors at **IIT Ropar** were very supportive throughout the journey.

**Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar** was always approachable. He runs a club called **Coder's High**. I reached out to him on LinkedIn, and he replied quickly and encouraged me.

He has a way of explaining things that actually stays with you. In today’s world, there is too much advice everywhere, and students often get confused. But the clarity he brings makes things feel right.

## A personal milestone

This was also my **first internship associated with IIT Ropar**.

Coming from a **Tier 2 college**, I was nervous in the beginning. I had self doubt about whether I would be able to match expectations at IIT Ropar. But slowly, that nervousness turned into confidence because the environment focused on learning and growth rather than pressure.

## Final takeaway

This internship at **IIT Ropar** taught me that sometimes what we avoid the most is exactly what we need. With the right guidance, structure, and mentorship, even a technology you once disliked can become meaningful.

I am still learning. But I am definitely growing. And for me, this journey at **IIT Ropar** truly matters.
