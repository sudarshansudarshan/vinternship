I’m just two weeks into this ten-week internship, but I can already feel a shift in how I think about learning.

Before this internship, my routine was pretty repetitive. Most of my time went into Data Structures and Algorithms. I kept solving problems and telling myself that I’d start learning the MERN stack later. “Later” never really came. Days passed, then weeks, and development always stayed on the to-do list.

This internship started to break that cycle.

When I began the hands-on MERN stack course on the ViBe platform, it felt uncomfortable. Not because the material was too hard, but because it pushed me out of what I was used to doing. The weekly milestones and deadlines meant I had to stay consistent. Development was no longer something I could delay—it became part of my regular learning.

ViBe doesn’t let you move forward without understanding. If something isn’t clear, you get stuck. That can be frustrating, but it also makes the learning feel real. You’re not just watching or skimming—you’re actually doing the work.

The case studies took this a step further. There were no clear instructions or quick answers. I had to think, try things out, make mistakes, and then try again. I often felt slow, but over time, I became more comfortable with that feeling. It stopped bothering me as much.

The daily stand-ups also became something I started looking forward to. The mentors—Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi V Ma'am, Sakshi Sharma Ma'am, Bhavna Ma'am, Harshadeep Ma'am, Jinal Gupta Ma'am, Nitin Sankar Sir—and the fellow interns made the sessions engaging. Polls, quizzes, and short learning activities kept things interactive and made the environment feel active rather than formal. I’m grateful to the Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design for organizing everything smoothly and for the insights shared so far.

Breakout room discussions have helped a lot too. Hearing how others approach the same problem in a completely different way often changes how I look at it. Sometimes, a short conversation clears confusion that I had been stuck on for hours.

I’m still early in this internship, but it has already influenced how I learn. Instead of constantly pushing things to “later,” I’m focusing on steady progress. I appreciate the way the VLED Lab has designed this experience around learning, reflection, and consistency. I’m looking forward to continuing this journey and seeing how it shapes me over the remaining weeks.
