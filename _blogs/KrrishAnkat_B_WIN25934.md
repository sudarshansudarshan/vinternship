title: "I Didn’t Avoid Web Development. I Just Never Started. Until Now."

For a long time, web development was something I thought about learning.

Not something I avoided. Not something I started either.

I watched videos. Read posts. Saved tutorials. Thought, “I’ll start properly soon.” But “soon” kept moving.

The hesitation wasn’t about interest. It was about the weight of it. Web development always felt huge... too many tools, too many frameworks, too many opinions. Every time I thought of starting, my brain jumped straight to the end instead of the beginning. So I stayed stuck in planning mode.

This Vinternship changed that - not by motivating me, but by making me start.

When I began learning through ViBe, I wasn’t aiming for completion. Even now, I’m only around halfway through the ViBe course, currently in TypeScript and midway into React. Case studies are at about 32%. That number matters, because it means this isn’t a success story yet. It’s a starting story.

What helped was that I wasn’t asked to “be ready” before beginning. I just had to show up and work with what I knew. TypeScript didn’t suddenly become easy. React didn’t instantly make sense. But I stopped waiting to feel confident before writing code.

That was new for me.

Earlier, I believed I had to understand everything before starting. Here, learning happened while doing. I wrote code even when I wasn’t fully sure. I broke things. I fixed some of them. Others stayed broken longer than I liked. And somehow, that was okay.

Case studies pushed this further. Even at 32%, they forced me to think instead of just follow steps. I couldn’t hide behind tutorials. I had to make choices... even imperfect ones. That made web development feel less like a distant skill and more like a process I was already inside.

The biggest change wasn’t technical.

It was this: I stopped treating learning as something I prepare for.

I used to think learning starts after the fear disappears. This Vinternship showed me that learning often creates clarity, not the other way around.

I’m still midway. Still confused at times. Still slow in places. But the difference is, I’ve started. Not in theory. In practice.

And that feels like real progress.
