When I began this online internship with VLED Lab, I did not have a clear roadmap in mind. I was curious, slightly anxious, and uncertain about what lay ahead. I often questioned whether I could maintain discipline in a remote setup and whether I would truly understand the concepts or simply finish tasks without meaningful learning.

As the internship progresses, I am gradually learning the importance of patience. In an online environment, it is easy to rush through lessons, but I am becoming more comfortable taking time to understand ideas that are not immediately clear. Initially, feeling stuck was discouraging. Now, I see it as a natural and valuable part of learning rather than an obstacle.

Despite being completely remote, regular check-ins and stand-up meetings provide a sense of structure to my routine. Some days feel productive, while others feel scattered, but I am beginning to understand that staying consistent—even on less productive days—is equally important. This consistency is slowly reshaping how I approach both work and learning.

This internship is also teaching me to be kinder and more patient with myself. The supportive environment encourages me to ask questions openly instead of rushing to find quick answers. While progress is not always immediately visible, it feels genuine and meaningful.

So far, this journey has been truly valuable for me. I sincerely appreciate VLED Labs and Sudarshan Iyengar for building a learning environment that feels authentic, supportive, and human—even in a virtual setting.
