The initial reaction on receiving the offer email was to just have an Internship under the for resume building and CVs. As this is my first Internship, I assumed it would be similar to what many of my college friends had described, where interns are usually assigned menial work, that is the work that no one wants to do is what the interns do.

The first Zoom session we had with the organizing team included an introduction video, which highlighted how the previous interns solved their doomscrolling issue with the Internship’s help, I too related to the issue, but believed that my case must be much worse than theirs and thought it wouldn’t work for me, cause how can an Internship solve something like that. But I am happy to say I was proven wrong.

The VIBE platform was the first thing introduced to us, which included lecture videos on the MERN stack designed to increase our technical knowledge on the topic. There was a sense of intimidation due to the previous experiences of learning from other platforms where the “In Progress” status tag of several courses still mocked me for not finishing what I had started.

I always knew consistency was the tool to learn something new, but I had never understood what it truly demanded. Being consistent also means accepting the fact that sometimes the progress will be highly accelerated and sometimes it will feel negligible. The VIBE platform was the first to make me experience this reality firsthand. Seeing my progress and my fellow interns’ progress’ on the leaderboard encouraged me to keep going even on slower days. Experiencing it firsthand made me realise just how important it is to practice consistency instead of chasing motivation, and I was able to finally complete the courses that were “In Progress” for years.

Moving on to the case studies, hearing the term it felt like this part of the Internship would be theoretical and uninspiring, but I was happy to see my assumptions were wrong once again. The case studies were nothing like what I expected, instead of long theoretical questions, the case studies focused on the practical knowledge based on the topics we learnt from VIBE and were a great tool for building our coding logic and problem-solving skills. 

The case studies were also the reason for interaction between the interns as we all solved them together. It was because of a case study that I joined my very first breakout room and had the opportunity to interact with my fellow interns. 

The breakout rooms were unlike anything I had experienced before, instead of everyone being on mute like how it usually goes for most online meetings, these sessions were filled with enthusiasm and a genuine desire to help each other and learn from each other. We were immediately able to bond not only over case studies but also concerns in our college lives and share knowledge about the different things each of us were pursuing to build our CVs and resumes. 

As the Internship continues it has already turned out to be very different from what I initially expected, both in the way it was executed and the super helpful fellow interns I had the opportunity to meet here. From learning the value of consistency to applying practical knowledge, to learning how to make yourselves visible and confident in a group setting, this experience is helping me better understand what professional growth looks like. I am looking forward to carrying these learnings in the professional journey forward.
