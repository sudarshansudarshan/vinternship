I’m happy to share my ongoing internship experience with IIT Ropar, where I’m currently pursuing MERN stack through NPTEL under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar.The internship is structured into three progressive phases, each designed to build both conceptual understanding and practical skills in full-stack development. I am currently progressing through the first phase of the program.

Through the ViBe learning platform, I’ve built a strong foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript and React. The course includes short videos and quizzes that helped me understand concepts clearly and implement them practically.

Collaborative Learning is the best part of this internship. One of the most valuable parts of this internship is the stand-up meetings and Zoom breakout room sessions. These were extremely useful for Clarifying doubts quickly, Discussing case studies with peers and Improving teamwork and communication.

Grateful for the guidance and the opportunity to learn in such a collaborative environment.I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to NPTEL, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, ANNAM.AI for their guidance, support, and encouragement throughout this journey.
