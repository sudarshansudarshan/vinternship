I am excited to share my internship experience so far at IIT Ropar, under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Sir. These initial weeks have been incredibly motivating, filled with learning, collaboration, and growth.

From the very beginning, I was extremely excited to join this internship, and that excitement reflected in my work. As part of the program, I started with the VIBE course, which I successfully completed within 3–4 days. Through consistency and focused effort, I secured the Top 1 position on the VIBE leaderboard, which gave me great confidence and motivation to push myself further.

After completing the course, I moved on to the case study phase. I completed the TypeScript case study and am currently working on the React case study, where I am gaining deeper clarity on concepts through practical implementation. The case studies are well-structured and encourage logical thinking and real-world problem-solving rather than rote learning.

One of the highlights of this internship has been the breakout sessions. We had an amazing session where our team completed a one-week case study milestone in just 3 hours, which truly showed the power of collaboration and focused teamwork. The stand-up meetings and live sessions are equally valuable, as they give us the opportunity to share our experiences, challenges, and learnings openly.

During breakout sessions, I not only learned from my peers but also got the opportunity to share my own work and knowledge. There were around 15–16 peers in breakout room, and we actively discussed case studies, exchanged ideas, and solved problems together. This peer-to-peer learning environment has greatly enhanced my understanding and communication skills.

Overall, these first two weeks of the internship have been highly productive and enriching. The emphasis on conceptual clarity, consistency, teamwork, and mentorship has helped me grow both technically and personally.

I am truly grateful to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir for his guidance and support, and to Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar for providing such a wonderful learning platform. I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks of this internship and am excited to continue learning, exploring, and improving myself further.
