# Second Chance

It all began with "I have to do certification courses". I felt like time is running out and I have to do some courses and I joined "Programming in Java" course offered by NPTEL.There I learned some basic concepts of Java and gave the final exam. Then results were announced and I scored 90% and was recognised as Elite Gold. I was very happy and I had no clue about internships.

Then I came to know that IIT Ropar is providing Internship for the student who achieved Elite Gold under the mentorship of Prof.Sudarshan Iyengar sir. And I was very excited to become the part of the intership.But, because of semester end examinations I had to leave the internship and I felt like I missed a great opportunity. I wrote email to vicharanashala stating the reason of discontinuing the internship and asked to consider me for the next cohort.

Then came the beautiful second chance.Vicharanashala was so kind to me and considered me for the next cohort. I was the happiest person and was eager to learn.

# ViBe

We were introduced to the platform called ViBe (Vikram Betal),where the videos duration will be of 2 minutes (max),after that automated questions are generated using AI.If we answer them correctly then only we can proceed further.Otherwise, same video will be repeated until we answer the questions correctly. And even if we talk in the middle or turn our faces around, would repeat the video.It was literally like Betal.

# Breakout Rooms

These were the rooms to discuss among peers.These rooms were really helpful to solve case studies. It made me possible to meet new people from different states. 

# Impact
It's been just 2.5 weeks out of 10 weeks.But it has made strong impact on my way of learning and being consistent.It taught me how to be disiplined and punctual.

# Gratitude
I heartfully thank the organizers of this internship and the helping hands who guided us:
