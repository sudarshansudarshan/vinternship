# My Pinternship Journey(As a part of call for Blogs)


I joined this Pinternship starting completely from scratch.

At the beginning, I didn’t have much clarity about the MERN stack or how real development learning actually works. Everything felt new, honestly. But the way learning happened through the ViBe courses slowly changed that feeling. The courses were hands-on, practical, and designed in a way that pushed me to try things on my own. With each session, my confidence grew—not because I knew everything, but because I was finally understanding how to learn.

As the internship is MERN-based, getting into documentation became a regular habit. Earlier, documentation felt heavy and confusing. Now, it feels like a guide. I learned how to read it patiently, search for what I need, and connect it with what I was building. That shift alone made a big difference in how I approach problems.

One of the most impactful parts of this journey has been the daily standups with Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir. They never felt like formal check-ins. Instead, they brought structure, clarity, and a sense of accountability to each day. Listening to others share their progress and challenges helped me stay consistent and focused on my own growth.

The breakout sessions were another highlight. These sessions gave us space to interact openly with senior interns and peers from our batch. We exchanged knowledge, discussed doubts, learned from each other’s approaches, and sometimes just talked and laughed. Meeting people from different parts of India, with different backgrounds and perspectives, made the learning environment more open and enjoyable. It never felt competitive—only collaborative.

As of now, I’ve completed 100% of the ViBe course, and I have moved forward with the case studies at a good and steady pace. More than the progress itself, I feel comfortable with the process. I no longer rush to understand everything instantly. I take my time, experiment, and trust that things will click eventually.

This Pinternship has helped me build confidence, consistency, and a healthier mindset toward learning and will continue to do so till i learn whole stack properly. I’m grateful to VLED Labs and also Nandan Prabhudesai Sir for creating such a supportive and well-structured learning space, and for constantly guiding us throughout this journey and also would like to add a sincere thanks to all the member of team Meenakshi Mam , Bhavna Mam ,Nitin Sir ,Rohit Sir helping us in each and every aspect .

This experience has genuinely shaped how I learn, think, and grow—and I’m looking forward to what comes next.
