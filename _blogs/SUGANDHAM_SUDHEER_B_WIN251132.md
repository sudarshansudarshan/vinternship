The first week of the Vinternship was an introduction to a new learning environment for me. Like any new platform, ViBe took a little time to understand. I initially had a few doubts regarding navigation and the overall flow, which is natural when starting something unfamiliar.

Instead of feeling stuck, I referred to the FAQs, followed the updates on the Cliq channels, and regularly attended the Zoom sessions. These resources helped me gain clarity step by step. Each session added more confidence, and the platform gradually started feeling comfortable.

By the end of the week, I was able to follow the learning process smoothly. What stood out to me was how structured support and consistent participation made adaptation easier. The experience reminded me that learning in a new environment becomes effective when we actively use the available resources and stay engaged.

This first week set a positive tone for the Vinternship and helped me understand the importance of being proactive, consistent, and open to new ways of learning.
