I am currently join a virtual internship offered by IIT-Ropar.

At first I think that internship means a type of job that does by freshers... but I'm wrong at that time... after joining this internship program , First time I experience a different type of growing or gaining the knowledge of Development in a very unique method .

For learning and understanding MernStack on ViBe platform that developed by Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design (VLED lab) . ViBe is a platform in which I gain knowledge of Mern in a clever way of teaching with ANNAM.AI that active my mind with quick quizzes , I'm really saw such a big difference in my attention span. My attention span is increase compare to older version of myself during learn on Vibe platform.

I attend Stand-ups. It is change my way of thinking . special thanks to our professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir to guide as well as give me an opportunity to do this internship. that one line said in a stand ups is hit me like a quote " Your 'network' is your 'net worth'. 

Case-Studies are also part of my internship journey. also do Case-studies parallel with Mern-stack . I gain a hands on practical learning doing by myself through case-studies.
