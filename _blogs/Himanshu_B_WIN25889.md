When I first joined the Vinternship at VLED Lab, I thought learning would mean finishing tasks, watching videos, and moving forward.

I was wrong.

What I did not expect was how often I would feel stuck.

There were days during the MERN sessions on ViBe when nothing seemed to land properly. Code that looked simple on screen refused to work on my laptop. Case studies pushed me into thinking instead of copying. At first, that was frustrating. I kept wondering whether everyone else understood faster than me.

But slowly, something shifted.

Instead of rushing to solutions, I started sitting with problems longer. I stopped panicking when bugs appeared. I learned to read errors instead of fearing them. Discussions in breakout rooms made me realize that confusion was not a weakness—it was common. Everyone was wrestling with something.

One moment that stayed with me was preparing for the viva. I realized how much I had actually absorbed—not because I memorized concepts, but because I had struggled through them. That struggle had quietly built confidence.

Working in teams and receiving feedback was another turning point. Earlier, feedback felt like judgment. Here, it felt like guidance. I began to see how growth happens faster when you let others look at your work.

This Vinternship did not just teach me how to build things with MERN.

It changed how I learn.

I am now more patient with myself. More consistent. More willing to admit when I do not know something—and more determined to figure it out.

If someone asked me what stayed with me after these weeks, it would not be a specific project or assignment.

It would be the realization that real learning is uncomfortable at first.

And that discomfort is exactly where growth begins.
