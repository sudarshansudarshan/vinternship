title: "I Thought This Was Just Another Internship, and I Was Wrong."

When this NPTEL Vinternship began, my first reaction wasn’t excitement — it was a slight mental overload.

New platform. New learning style. New expectations.

For the first few days, it honestly felt like a small headache trying to understand how everything worked. It was different from the structured learning I was used to, and adapting took time. But instead of trying to control the experience, I decided to simply go with the flow.

That decision changed everything.

Learning through the ViBe platform turned out to be very different from my usual approach to courses. Instead of rushing to complete modules, I started engaging with concepts step by step. The hands-on learning style made me slow down and actually understand what I was building rather than just finishing lessons.

Gradually, learning became interesting rather than overwhelming.

The case studies played a major role in this shift. At first, they looked challenging, but while working through them, I realized they were not testing memory — they were shaping how I think. Each problem required applying concepts practically, experimenting with approaches, and learning through mistakes. Many times, the learning happened during the struggle itself.

Another highlight of this journey has been the standup sessions. These sessions brought energy and interaction into the internship. The quizzes conducted through Kahoot were especially engaging — they tested both my understanding and my ability to recall concepts quickly. Competing alongside fellow interns made learning fun while also revealing areas where I needed improvement.

Being part of the Dijkstrians Cohort Batch added a strong sense of community to the experience. Watching others learn, struggle, and grow alongside me created motivation to stay consistent. Everyone progressed differently, yet the shared journey made the process more meaningful.

Over time, I noticed small but important changes in myself. I became more patient while solving problems. I started thinking before jumping into code. Learning stopped feeling like a checklist and started feeling like exploration.

This Vinternship did not create a sudden transformation. Instead, it introduced gradual shifts in discipline, mindset, and confidence. The growth was quiet, almost unnoticeable day to day, but clear when I looked back.

What began with confusion slowly turned into curiosity.

I would like to sincerely thank Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, Prof. Nandan Prabhudesai, and the entire Vicharanashala (Lab for Education Design) team for designing such a thoughtful learning environment. From ViBe learning and case studies to standups, quizzes, and continuous guidance, every element contributed to this experience.

I am also grateful to thank my mentors and fellow interns whose collaboration made this journey engaging and motivating.

Sometimes learning doesn’t begin with clarity. Sometimes it begins when you simply choose to go with the flow.
