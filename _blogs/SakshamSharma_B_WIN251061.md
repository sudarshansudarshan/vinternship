If I’m being honest, I went into this Vinternship, expecting a checklist: watch the lectures, submit the assignments, work on a project, get the certificate. I didn’t realize I was there to relearn how to learn.

The first shock to the system was ViBe. It wasn't just a platform where I press play and scroll through my phone while the video runs in the background. It required all my attention , to focus on the lectures, answering quizzes. At first, it felt restrictive, but something shifted ,I stopped multitasking, I stopped skimming. I was forced to actually be there. That’s when the real struggle and the real fun began!

The Vinternship isn’t designed to hold my hand. I moved from the structured learning on ViBe to solving case studies, and that transition is where the "student" mindset had to die, and the "developer" mindset had to take over. The case studies are very challenging. There are times when my code just wouldn't work. In a normal course, I might have looked up a tutorial or asked for the "right" answer. But here, the goal wasn't the answer, it was the struggle.

I learned that consistency is uncomfortable. It’s easy to code when someone is motivated and everything works. It’s about the realization that learning isn't a passive activity you absorb; it’s an active fight you have to win every single day. Most importantly, I learned that attention is a currency, and for the first time, I learned how to spend it wisely.

This internship stripped away the safety net of 'classroom learning.' It forced me to become my own debugger, my own motivator, and my own teacher. I learned that the feeling of being 'stuck' isn't a sign of failure—it's the exact moment where the real development begins.

I would like to thank Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar , NPTEL and Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar for providing me with this opportunity, Nandan Prabhudesai Sir for mentoring an amazing and honestly challenging MERN course. I would also like to thank Rohit Sharma , Nitin Sankar , ANNAM.AI , Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design , Harshdeep R. for providing their support in moving ahead with this Vinternship.
