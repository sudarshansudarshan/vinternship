When I started my internship at VLED Lab, I thought it would mainly be about learning skills and completing tasks.

I didn’t expect it to change how I think about people and connections.

One thing our mentor Sudarshan Iyengar often repeated was the idea of the “strength of weak ties.” At first, I didn’t fully understand it. How can weak ties be strong? Aren’t close friendships and strong bonds more important?

But slowly, through this program, it started making sense.

In this internship, we interact with many people we don’t know well — sometimes complete strangers. Different colleges, backgrounds, skills, and goals. Normally, we might hesitate to talk to new people or stay only within our comfort circle.

But here, we were encouraged to connect.

And I realized something powerful:

Sometimes, the people who open new doors for you are not your closest friends, but the people you meet along the way.

A short conversation, a shared idea, a small collaboration — these “weak ties” can bring new perspectives, opportunities, and learning. They push you outside your bubble.

Personally, I’m someone who doesn’t like networking just for benefits. I prefer meaningful connections. But this internship showed me that connecting doesn’t have to be fake or forced. It can simply be about learning from each other and growing together.

I also faced moments of hesitation:

Should I message first?

What if they don’t respond?

What if I sound awkward?

But every small step built confidence.

This journey taught me that growth is not only technical. It’s also about communication, openness, and being willing to step forward even when unsure.

My biggest takeaway?

Opportunities often come from conversations you almost didn’t start.

 Learning can come from people you just met.

 Growth begins when comfort ends.

I’m grateful to Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design and the mentors for creating a space where collaboration and connection are encouraged.

Don’t just complete tasks. Talk to people. Share ideas. Ask questions. Build connections.

You never know which “weak tie” might become a strong turning point in your journey.
