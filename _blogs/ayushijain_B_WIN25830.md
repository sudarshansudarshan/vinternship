Kind Of Learning That Stays With You !!

Article content
Stepping into my winter Internship under Prof Sudarshan Iyengar sir , I found myself in an environment that pushed me to learn , adapt and innovate every single day . > In our stand-up he stated the line of W. Dijkstra -:

 "Testing shows the presence , not the absence of bugs." 
he meant that check, review and improve constantly , instead of assuming all is well.

>In this internship , currently I have learnt typescript , react js and further stepping into mongodb and vibe platform provided to us to learn and revise by quizzes under Nandan Prabhudesai sir.

>For me Case studies are highlight as it helped me to getting into the habit of reading documentation and solve problems of given questions in it which made a big difference in me towards the way of approaching problem.

>Then here comes the breakout sessions which helped us to discuss about the problem statement in case studies , to know the perspective of our seniors , to connect with our peers and to learn about different approaches to same problem statement and creating positive environment .

>Initially it was getting very tough for me to align with the college curriculum but over these two weeks learning stopped feeling like a responsibility and started feeling like a process I wanted to be part of . This shift itself is a highlight in my journey so far !!

>My takeaways I learnt a lot from others by sharing our ideas, thoughts and by interacting with each other and felt the change in me "the journey between who I was and who I am becoming"

I'm grateful to VLED Labs and its team member Sakshi Sharma mam, Jinal Gupta mam, Nitin Sankar sir ,@Rohit sharma sir and whole system to create such a wonderful , collaborative environment where we can learn, collaborate and grow.

>Open for suggestions, to learn and grow ahead !!
