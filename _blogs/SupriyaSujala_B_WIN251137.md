INTRO:
I am currently undergoing an internship in MERN stack course through the NPTEL online internship program
by Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar under the guidance of Prof.Sudarshan Iyengar . The course focuses 
on both theoretical as well as practical knowledge which help me understand real-world applications of web 
technologies. The objective of this internship is to provide technical skill for which we are provided 
virtual classes, case studies, projects as well as some activities which lead to increase our networking. 
This is one of the activities.

ABOUT VIBE PLATFORM:
As it's already been two weeks so, I would like to share my experience on vibe platform. The thing is that 
the platform is designed in such a way that fits our generation because we have a habit of watching one or 
two minutes shorts videos and forgetting everything right after it .But what vibe does is that it provide 
quizzes after each videos, which forces me to be focused throughout the video. This is really helpful for me 
specially because, I always fall asleep while watching study videos on YouTube . Sometime it gets frustrating
when I have to watch same video for more than three times to get the right answer. But it's okay because that 
the whole point of the platform. Overall it's not like i am just completing the videos instead i am actually 
progressing.

CHALLENGES:
After two-three days of internship, some of my cohort member completed the course already and ready for the 
case studies . I felt unsure of myself that,I am not good enough. But our teachers guided us that "A journey 
of a thousand miles begins with a single step, no matter how small". With college sometime it gets difficult 
to manage and here comes the consistency, since it's a 10 weeks program consistency plays a crucial role in
making an internship successful. one thing i would like to convey that journey is ment to be different for 
each individual.

SKILL:
Through the internship,I am not only developing my technical skills but soft skill as well like time management,
self learning and problem solving. communication skill through break-out sessions and many more.These soft skill 
will play important role in shaping my future career.

CONCLUSION:
Overall we are getting the full package. Interacting with teachers through standup, getting the feel of having
classmates in breakout session, getting solved our queries through mails and interactive feature of vibe platform.
At the end i would like to say that i will reach the end with a lots of knowledge...

My sincere thanks 🙏🏻 to Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design ,Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, ANNAM.AI and the mentors
at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar whose guidance and belief making this journey meaningful.
