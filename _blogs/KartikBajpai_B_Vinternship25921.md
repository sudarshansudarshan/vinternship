Midway through my internship journey at **Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar**, under the guidance of **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar**, I find myself reflecting less on milestones and more on how my approach to learning has changed.

This internship has never felt like a checklist. Instead, it has been a continuous learning journey—sometimes clear, sometimes uncomfortable, but always meaningful.

## Strengthening the Fundamentals

The experience began with a hands-on **MERN stack course on the ViBe platform**. Even with prior knowledge of MERN, the course helped me strengthen my fundamentals and discover perspectives I hadn’t explored before. It reinforced an important idea: learning isn’t always about something completely new; often, it’s about understanding familiar concepts more deeply.

## Learning Through Case Studies

As I moved into **case studies**, learning became less structured and more real. These problems don’t hand you solutions. They push you to think, doubt, discuss, and iterate—much closer to how development works in practice.

## Breakout Rooms and Peer Learning

One of the most impactful parts of this journey has been the **breakout rooms**. Each week, I entered a random room, worked with new people, and solved problems together. New people brought new ideas, different reasoning styles, and fresh ways of thinking.

These interactions quietly reshaped my confidence. Seeing others struggle with similar doubts reminded me that learning is rarely linear—everyone is figuring things out in their own imperfect way. That realization lifted a pressure I didn’t even realize I was carrying.

## Gratitude and Looking Ahead

I’m truly grateful to the mentors and developers for their guidance and feedback, and to **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar** for designing an internship that values growth, consistency, and responsibility. Platforms like **ViBe** stand out because they emphasize experience, discussion, and reflection—not just instruction.

As I continue navigating the case studies, I’m eager to contribute to **real-world projects** and learn through real responsibility.

*Still learning. Still growing. Looking forward to what’s next.*
