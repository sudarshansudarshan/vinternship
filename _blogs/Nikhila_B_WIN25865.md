I'm happy to share my experience so far in the 10-week virtual internship under NPTEL at IIT Ropar. The learning process has been engaging and well-structured, making it a valuable experience.

💻 Learning on ViBe Platform

A major part of my learning has been through the ViBe platform, where I've completed JavaScript and TypeScript and am currently exploring React. The platform used AI proctoring with short, focused video modules which span around 1-2 minutes, followed by quizzes.

This quiz-based approach turned out to be one of my favorite aspects. It feels less like an assignment and more like a fun, interactive way to check how attentive we were during the sessions.

🤝 Collaboration & Interaction

What truly enhances the experience are the stand-up sessions. These sessions act as interactive points where we connect with the mentors, share progress, discuss challenges, and stay updated with the announcements.

In addition, the Zoom breakout rooms have been incredibly valuable. Working alongside peers in smaller groups, discussing case studies, and learning from different perspectives has helped me gain exposure beyond individual learning.

🚀 Growth & Takeaways

This journey has helped me understand the importance of building strong fundamentals and learning consistently. More than just technologies, I'm learning how real learning ecosystems function—through interaction, reflection, and shared growth.

Grateful to VLED Labs , ANNAM.AI, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , NPTEL , and to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar for their constant support.
