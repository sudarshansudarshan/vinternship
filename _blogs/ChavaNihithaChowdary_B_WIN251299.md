When I first saw the Vinternship offer, it honestly felt too huge for me. A reputed institution offering such a structured internship made me nervous, yet at the same time I felt extremely happy because I had never experienced something this rigorous and dedicated before. Even before it properly began, I was rushing between my holidays and college to arrange my bonafide, which itself felt like the beginning of something serious and professional. After attending the first classes, going through the FAQs, and understanding the ViBe platform, everything felt overwhelming. There was structure, clarity, and expectations that were completely new to me. But along with that feeling of pressure, I also felt lucky. ViBe Vicharanashala (Lab for Education Design) became a strong foundation for learning the MERN stack properly—not casually, but with consistency and focus. The flexibility of the internship helped me balance academics and learning without feeling burdened, which made the experience even more meaningful.

The health points system was an interesting part of this journey. It encouraged consistency and created a healthy sense of competition among us, motivating me to stay regular and disciplined. The Zoom meetings, breakout room discussions, and LinkedIn interactions gradually improved my communication skills. From being someone who would simply listen during sessions to actively engaging with peers and mentors, I could clearly see my growth. This internship feels authentic—like college because of the friendships and teamwork, like home because of the flexibility, and like a corporate environment because of the responsibility and structure. The case studies, however, were the real turning point. They were challenging and pushed me beyond basic coding. They made me think deeply, analyze problems carefully, and understand concepts instead of just finishing tasks.

Through every challenge, I discovered strength within myself. Each difficulty I faced and overcame made me more confident. The journey from sitting in a classroom as a student to interacting professionally with mentors and peers feels like a real transition from college learning to corporate thinking. From the rush to arrange my bonafide, to the steady effort of earning health points, to the pressure of case studies and the excitement of building projects, this experience has shaped me in ways I never expected. This internship is not just about learning the MERN stack; it is about discipline, consistency, self-belief, and growing through discomfort. It truly feels like a bridge between college and corporate life, and I am proud to be part of this journey. Special thanks to Prof Sudarshan Iyengar Sir for guiding and inspiring us throughout this experience.
