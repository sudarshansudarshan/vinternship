When I first received the email confirming my MERN Stack internship under the guidance of Sudarshan Iyengar at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , I had a very specific mental image of what lay ahead. I expected a "normal" online program: sitting through long modules, watching recorded lectures, and eventually receiving a certificate.

However, the first induction session completely shattered that perspective.

From Passive Watching to Active Networking
Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar made it clear from day one: this internship isn't just about mastering a tech stack; it’s about mastering the power of the cohort.

He emphasized that networking isn't just an "offline" skill. In today's world, reflecting your presence and ideas online - specifically through platforms like LinkedIn - is essential. This was a turning point for me. I realized that my growth wouldn't just come from code, but from connecting with my fellow mates, sharing insights, and being visible in the professional community.

The "Micro-Touchpoint" Model & The Vibe Platform
The program’s structure is designed to keep us engaged rather than overwhelmed. We use the Vibe platform, which reinvents learning through "short-form" modules. Imagine the addictive nature of YouTube Shorts, but repurposed for high-level technical education.

To maintain this momentum over the 10-week program, we follow a unique "Micro-Touchpoint" schedule:

⚡ Weeknights (Mon/Wed/Fri): 20–30 minute "pulse" sessions to stay aligned.
🧠 Weekends: 2-hour deep-dive sessions where the real collaborative building happens.

We aren't just students; we are active participants. Between breakout rooms for case study discussions and constant interaction with peers, the environment is built on the 3 E’s: Enjoyable, Entertaining, and Engaging.

Connecting the Dots: The 60-Year Curriculum & Intelligence Augmentation
A definitive highlight of this journey was the VLED Global Speaker Series, where we had the privilege of hearing from Chris Dede . He discussed a shift in how we view the future of work: moving from Artificial Intelligence (AI) toward Intelligence Augmentation (IA) - the idea that technology should not replace us, but rather work alongside us to amplify our human capabilities.

This session led me to the first chapter of his book, The 60-Year Curriculum, which fundamentally reshaped my definition of lifelong learning. It’s a philosophy that aligns perfectly with the research from the NRC (2012) and OECD (2018), suggesting that 21st-century employability requires a balance of three critical dimensions:

The Cognitive: Beyond technical proficiency, it requires flexibility, creativity, and intellectual openness.
The Interpersonal: Mastering collaboration and conflict resolution - the very "human" skills we practice in our internship breakout rooms.
The Intrapersonal: Developing "Personal Agency" - taking individual responsibility for our own growth and ethical trajectory.

I am excited to continue this journey - both through this internship and in life - guided by the insights from Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar. I look forward to growing not just as a developer, but as a thoughtful citizen, a connected professional, and a lifelong learner...
