From missing an NPTEL winter internship because of regular academic time constraints to getting another academic-friendly opportunity, the experience felt truly amazing. It felt like a second chance that came at the right time. 
Being a second-year student with absolutely no background in full-stack development made me question myself a lot. I often wondered whether I would be able to pull it off at all. 

 However, the ViBe platform slowly began to change that mindset. The learning was practical and experience-based rather than rote learning, which made a big difference for me. The quizzes, dashboards, and progress tracking acted as a driving force to keep going and complete the course. 
 Instead of just watching content, I found myself becoming more determined and focused on understanding the topics properly.

 This journey also made me more active on LinkedIn and helped me reduce unnecessary social media distractions. Even though ViBe had its own bugs and issues, seeing them being addressed and improved made the learning feel more real. 
 It showed me that there is always room to improve — not just in platforms, but also in ourselves. From feeling confused and anxious to slowly becoming more confident and consistent, this internship helped me grow not just technically, but personally as well. Connecting with new people, sharing thoughts, listening to different perspectives, and learning together played a big role in this transformation. Overall,
 
 this experience made me realize something very simple yet powerful: "Your network is your net worth". 

 Special thanks to Sudarshan Iyengar and the Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design , Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , for this learning opportunity.
