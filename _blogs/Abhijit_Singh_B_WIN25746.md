I recently began my NPTEL Vinternship in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, under Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar.

Just yesterday, we had our first Zello catch-up—a walkie-talkie–style discussion where only one person could speak at a time. It was slightly awkward, but very real. Turns out, speaking one at a time makes conversations feel oddly human. A small moment, but a reminder that slowing down and listening carefully brings clarity. (IYKYK.)

The internship itself is structured into three parts: **VIBE**, where we learn the MERN stack through short videos and quizzes; **Case Studies**, where we apply concepts to real-world problems; and **Projects**, where everything comes together.

VIBE changed how I approached learning. You can’t move forward unless you truly understand a concept. Getting an answer wrong means revisiting the idea—not skipping it. Initially, it felt slow, but repetition made even complex topics click. By the end of the first week, I had completed the MERN content and started seeing how front-end and back-end pieces connect.

The case studies were a turning point. They didn’t offer neatly defined problems. Instead, they pushed me to read documentation, work through ambiguity, and think about trade-offs—skills that matter beyond writing code.

Breakout sessions made the experience even richer. Discussing problems with peers and seniors showed me how different perspectives can solve the same issue in different ways. Learning felt shared, not isolated.

Looking back, three ideas quietly tied everything together for me. The *strength of weak ties* showed up in peer discussions. *“Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”* came alive through feedback and iteration. And the *limits of computation* reminded me that no single person—or system—can know everything alone.

This Vinternship reinforced something important: learning works best when it’s distributed—across people, perspectives, and constant reflection.

I’m grateful to the VLED Lab, NPTEL, IIT Ropar, Nitin Sankar, Sakshi Sharma ma’am, and the entire mentor team for creating an environment where learning is thoughtful, collaborative, and real.
