I joined the Vinternship with a lot of excitement and curiosity. I was eager to explore something new and see how this experience would unfold. From the very beginning, it was clear that this wouldn’t be a typical learning setup.

The first few sessions on the ViBe platform felt different from anything I had used before. The content was delivered through short 1:30–2:00 minute videos, each followed by a quiz. This format was new to me. It required constant attention and made sure I was actively engaging with the material instead of passively watching.

As I progressed, the quizzes helped reinforce concepts immediately. They made me pause, think, and reflect before moving ahead. Learning felt structured and focused, even in short bursts.

Working on the case studies added another dimension. They pushed me to apply what I had learned rather than just understand it theoretically. Some problems were straightforward, while others required more thought and experimentation. This helped me identify areas where I needed to slow down and revisit concepts.

The standup sessions were another highlight. Sharing updates, discussing challenges, and listening to others’ approaches made the learning experience more interactive. These sessions encouraged reflection, clarity, and accountability, making learning feel less isolated.

Overall, this Vinternship guided by Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design (VLED Labs) and Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar introduced me to a different way of learning—one that values attention, structure, and reflection. It helped me stay engaged and intentional throughout the process.

I’m grateful for this experience and look forward to building on what I’ve learned in the upcoming phases.
