It has been almost a month since I joined the NPTEL Winter Internship under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir at IIT Ropar, and the learning experience I've gone through has been quite different from what I was used to before. Instead of focusing on completing tasks as fast as possible, the focus is on learning step by step and understanding concepts properly.

The internship begins with the ViBe course. In which, the lessons are delivered through short reels style videos that require one's full attention. It is not possible to watch them passively. At first this felt very hard. But, after some time I realized that it helped me stay focused and understand the concepts more clearly.

We also worked on case studies which push us to think and solve problems independently. These case studies do not come with solutions, so we have to plan and implement our own solution. 

Another important part of the internship are the standup meetings held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. These sessions helped motivate us and give everyone a chance to share progress and learning.

The breakout room sessions are a unique collaborative aspect to the internship. Working with co-interns from different backgrounds and solving problems togther has made learning more enjoyable.

This internship so far has taught me the importance of patience and consistency and I am looking forward to improve myself as the internship progresses.
