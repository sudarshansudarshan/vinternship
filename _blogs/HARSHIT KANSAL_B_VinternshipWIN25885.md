I am currently pursuing an internship under Sudarshan Iyengar , IIT Ropar, where I am learning the MERN Stack in a structured and encouraging environment.

One of the most refreshing aspects of this internship is the well-balanced pace - the deadlines are challenging enough to keep us engaged, yet not overwhelming. The course content delivered through the ViBe platform truly pushed me to go beyond my comfort zone and explore concepts more deeply rather than just completing tasks.

The live sessions conducted by Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar & VLED Labs' team ( Rohit Sharma, Jinal Gupta , Nitin Sankar , Harshdeep R. , Sakshi Sharma ) have been particularly impactful. They were not only technically insightful but also highly motivating, making complex ideas feel approachable and inspiring us to think independently.

Like any new platform, we initially faced several technical issues on ViBe. However, credit where it’s due - the VLED Labs' team responded promptly and resolved the issues within a week, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

What I appreciate most is the program’s effort to encourage peer interaction and collaboration. Even though the internship is primarily technical, its design clearly focuses on holistic development, helping students grow in communication, collaboration, and other essential soft skills alongside technical expertise.

Overall, this internship has been a valuable journey of learning, exploration, and growth—and I’m excited to keep building on this experience.

Grateful for the opportunity and looking forward to what’s ahead.
