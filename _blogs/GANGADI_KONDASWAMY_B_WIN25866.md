I have recently completed an important part of my Pinternship with the VLED Lab at IIT Ropar by finishing the first phase of the internship. This phase was mainly focused on helping us learn the basics of the MERN stack, which is an important technology for web development. It was a great starting point because it helped me understand how full-stack development works and prepared me for the next steps of the internship.

Even though the internship is happening completely online, the experience has been very smooth and well-organized. I never felt that I was missing out because the learning process was designed in such a way that it stayed interesting and engaging. The activities were planned properly, and the environment motivated me to stay regular and focused throughout this phase.

A big part of this learning journey started with the ViBe (Vikram–Betal) platform. The platform uses a very simple and effective method of teaching. Instead of long lectures, the topics were explained through very short videos that were easy to understand. This made learning feel lighter and less stressful, and it helped me stay attentive while studying new concepts.

What made the learning even better was that after each short video, there was a small quiz. These quizzes helped me check whether I understood the topic correctly or not. It also helped me learn from mistakes immediately instead of waiting until the end. This kind of learning kept me active and involved, and it helped me build a better understanding step by step.

Along with the platform learning, we also had live online sessions and regular standup meetings. These sessions made the internship more interactive because we could ask doubts, listen to discussions, and learn from others. The standup meetings gave a sense of routine and responsibility, which helped me stay consistent and connected with the internship process.

This learning journey has been made possible through the guidance and structured approach provided by VLED Labs (VicharanaSala) at IIT Ropar, under the mentorship of Sudarshan Iyengar.

I am looking forward to exploring the upcoming phases, taking on new challenges, and continuing to grow through this internship experience.

Excited for what comes next in this journey of learning and development…
