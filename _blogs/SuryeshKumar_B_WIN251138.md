## AI Enabled Internship Structure


I started my internship journey by learning **MERN stack technologies** through the **ViBe platform**. This internship is being conducted at **IIT Ropar** with **VLED Labs**, supervised by **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar**, which makes this experience very valuable for my learning journey.




The internship is divided into **three stages**:

1. **Training**  
2. **Case Study**  
3. **Project**




Currently, I am at the **initial stage – Training**, which is completely conducted on the **ViBe platform**.

ViBe is an **AI-proctored learning platform** that detects anomalies such as background noise and multiple faces during learning sessions. If such activities are detected, a **penalty score increases**. When the penalty reaches a certain limit, the course or quiz restarts.

Initially, this system felt strict, but later I realized that it helps in maintaining **focus, discipline, and seriousness** towards learning. It improves concentration and makes the learning experience more effective.

So far, I have completed **around 60% of the first stage**, and soon I will move on to the **case study phase**.


The **case study phase** is fully **hands-on** and focuses on practical learning along with core concepts of:

- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **MongoDB**
- **Express**

After completing the case studies, interns get the opportunity to work on **real projects with developers**, which helps in gaining real-world experience.

## Learning Environment & Mentorship

Along with technical learning, we also have **breakout sessions** where I and other co-interns discuss case studies and prepare for **viva**.

We also attend **stand-up sessions**, where our mentors **Sakshi Sharma, Jinal Gupta, Meenakshi V, Rohit Sharma, and Nitin Sankar** guide us and share important updates.
  
For internship-related queries such as **attendance or health points**, we have **ViSakha**, a smart chat interface designed to answer FAQs, which makes communication easier.

## Overall Experience

This internship has provided a completely new experience in my learning journey. It has helped me grow not only technically but also in discipline, communication, and professional development.
