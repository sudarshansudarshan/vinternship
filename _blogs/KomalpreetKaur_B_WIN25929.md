Two weeks of my 2.5-month internship have just wrapped up, and it has already been a wonderful and memorable experience.

This is actually my second time getting selected for this internship. Last summer, I joined with great excitement, but unfortunately, I had to discontinue in between because of my exams. I still remember how downhearted I felt at that time because I knew how valuable the opportunity was. Letting it go was difficult.

But *"God always has something special planned for you — you just have to wait for the right time."* This winter season truly felt like a special gift. Getting selected again, and that too for an even more thrilling experience, made me realize the truth behind the saying:

*“Sabr ka fal meetha hota hai.”*

Even when I compare both internships, I can confidently say this winter one feels much more engaging and enjoyable. With ViBe video lectures, analogy-based case studies, short stand-up meetings, quizzes with sweet background music, and interactive sessions, it genuinely feels like I’m learning while also enjoying the process. No doubt the AI proctoring feels frustrating at times, but I think that it helps me stay focused. Even the name is ViBe , Vikram Betal, where the “Betal” (AI proctoring) is constantly watching, pushing us to stay honest in our efforts. 

One of the most valuable parts has been the special weekend meetings with seniors from the previous cohort. Their experiences and sharing of mistakes give us guidance regarding what to do and what not, including how to not lose our Health points!

The breakout rooms are most beautiful addition. Being able to meet co-interns face-to-face, discuss doubts, and help each other truly proves that “Peer learning is the best learning.”

I’ve met some really amazing people , some shy while some extremely confident.

Sudarshan Iyengar sir's quotes and new terminologies have added a completely new dimension to my thinking. Stories and concepts like, your network is your net worth, runners’ hype, Gross Domestic Happiness in Bhutan, hype cycle, AI winter, and the strength of weak ties — these were ideas I had never been introduced to before. They help me grow personally and see the world with a broader perspective.

Overall, these two weeks have shown me that this is not just an internship — it is a growing space. A space where learning, fun, discipline, peer bonding, and personal development come together. At last , I would like to say that:

*This is the kind of environment where I don’t just want to complete an internship. This is the kind of growing space where I would love to stay, learn, and evolve for a lifetime.*
