I joined the Pinternship with no real understanding of the MERN stack and very little clarity about how real development learning works. Everything felt unfamiliar at first—tools, concepts, even the way problems were framed. I wasn’t confident, but I was willing to begin.

What gradually changed my perspective was the learning approach through the ViBe platform. It wasn’t about watching and moving on. It required me to try, fail, and figure things out on my own. That process wasn’t easy, but it was honest. Over time, my confidence grew—not because I knew everything, but because I learned how to learn.

Since the internship is MERN-based, working with documentation became a daily habit. Earlier, documentation felt overwhelming and confusing. Now, it feels like a guide. I learned how to read it patiently, search with intent, and connect it directly to what I was building. That shift changed the way I approach problem-solving.

The daily standups with Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir brought structure and accountability to each day. They never felt like pressure. Listening to others share their struggles and progress reminded me that learning is different for everyone—and that consistency matters more than speed.

Breakout sessions added another meaningful layer. Interacting with peers and senior interns, exchanging ideas, discussing doubts, and learning from different perspectives made the environment collaborative rather than competitive. Connecting with people from different parts of the country made the journey even more enriching.

At this point, I’ve completed the ViBe course and progressed steadily through the case studies. More importantly, I’ve become comfortable with the process. I no longer rush to understand everything instantly. I take my time, experiment, and trust that clarity will come.

This Pinternship has helped me build confidence, consistency, and a healthier mindset toward learning. I’m grateful to VLED Lab, Nandan Prabhudesai Sir, and the entire team for creating such a supportive and thoughtfully structured learning space.

This experience has genuinely changed how I learn, think, and grow—and I’m excited for what comes next.
