title: "A personal reflection on how Vinternship reshaped the way I approach learning."

During my Vinternship with VLED Lab, I encountered a form of learning that felt different from what I was used to.

This internship was not designed as a checklist of tasks to complete or concepts to finish. Instead, it unfolded as a learning journey—one that required patience, reflection, and consistent effort. There were moments when ideas felt clear and progress seemed visible, followed by moments where the same ideas felt uncertain again.

Initially, I interpreted this uncertainty as a lack of progress. Over time, I realized it was an essential part of learning. Growth here was not immediate or linear; it developed gradually through practice and engagement.

The case studies played a key role in this shift. They emphasized reasoning over correctness and encouraged thoughtful problem-solving rather than quick answers. This helped me focus more on understanding problems deeply instead of rushing toward solutions.

Another important lesson was the value of consistency. Regular participation—regardless of confidence—slowly strengthened both understanding and mindset.

When the sessions ended, what remained was not just technical exposure, but a more mature approach to learning itself.

I am grateful to ANNAM.AI, Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design, Sudarshan Iyengar, and Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar NPTEL for fostering a reflective and meaningful learning environment.
