When I joined the VLED Lab internship, I honestly didn’t know what to expect. I thought it would be just another online program with videos and assignments.

At the start, learning the MERN stack was not easy. Many times i didn't understand what was being taught , and I didn’t even know why. Small concepts took a lot of time. Sometimes it felt frightening, especially when others seemed to understand faster.

The case studies were different from normal practice questions. There were no spoon feedings, so I had to think on my own. At first that was confusing, but later I understood that this was helping me learn better.

Breakout room discussions also helped because everyone had different ideas. It made me realize that there is no single correct solution in coding. One thing this internship taught me was consistency. Even when I didn’t feel like studying, doing a little every day helped.

Overall, this experience changed how I see learning. I learned that struggling is normal, and improvement takes time.
