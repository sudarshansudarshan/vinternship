When I started my internship with Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design Lab (VLED Lab), I didn’t fully know what to expect. Like many interns, I was excited but also unsure about how things would unfold. And then this all started by,

console.log("hello world");
Just like every developer starts with console.log("Hello, World!"), my journey here feels like the beginning of something bigger, progress that’s only going forward from here.

The journey started with learning through a well developed learning platform, ViBe that provides structured courses covering the technologies we would later apply in real projects. Our learning journey began on the ViBe Learning Platform, where Vi stands for Vikram and Be stands for Betal, inspired by the idea that learning sticks with you just like the famous Vikram and Betal stories. Just like Betal wouldn’t leave King Vikram until the puzzle was solved, the platform doesn’t let you move ahead until you truly understand the concept and successfully complete the quiz. This ensures that learning isn’t rushed, concepts stay with you before you move to the next step.

It turns learning into an engaging challenge where progress is earned through understanding, not just watching videos. The platform includes course videos, concept explanations, and quizzes after each module, which helped reinforce learning step by step. I spent time watching the sessions, clearing concepts, and completing quizzes. One interesting and motivating feature is the leaderboard, where interns can see their progress and ranking among peers. This healthy competition encouraged consistency and pushed me to improve continuously.

After completing these learning modules, we moved on to case studies, which felt like real world scenarios where we could apply what we learned. Slowly, things became more practical and less theoretical.

Another engaging element of the internship is the HP (Health Points) system, where we earn points through completing activities, following guidelines, and helping fellow interns. Supporting each other and staying active directly boosts our HP, which also improves our ranking on the leaderboard. This system makes learning collaborative rather than competitive, encouraging everyone to grow together while staying motivated.

A glimpse of my learning journey and progress so far.
The next exciting step is working towards projects, where all the learning starts taking shape in real applications.

Another important part of this internship is the daily stand up meetings. These meetings helped us stay connected share progress, and learn from each other. Through these interactions, I made new connections and friends. Currently, many of us are collaborating in a hackathon, which has strengthened teamwork and networking even more. Working together under time pressure brings out creativity and builds strong professional connections.

I would also like to acknowledge the guidance and philosophy shared by our mentors. The support and motivation from Sudarshan Iyengar have been inspiring. Their approach towards learning and collaboration encourages curiosity, kindness, and continuous improvement.

Grateful for the opportunity to learn through this experience connected with ANNAM.AI and the ecosystem supported by Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar.

Looking back, I can see how much more confident and capable I have become since day one. And the journey is still continuing. Every step, every challenge, and every learning moment adds something valuable to the journey.

And this journey is just getting started!!
