I was really surprised and excited when I got a mail regarding NPTEL Winter internship under Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and his team, IIT Ropar. I didn't want to lose this chance so I applied soon. On my first stand up session I got to know about what this internship is all about and got introduced to an interesting platform called ViBe. I never knew that a platform like this existed it was really surprising and the way it works to make us listen to the contents clearly is also interesting.

I didn't have any prior knowledge on MERN stack so I thought of taking a slow pace then they let us know the milestones we have to meet each week. But the milestones weren't the ones which actually pushed me to make my progress, it was my co-intern because they were like so crazy completing 4 week's milestone within a week and stuff. I was like I should work on it too by learning and also maintaining a good pace. I sat with the platform for like few hours daily till now which made me consistent which I was not used to be but always wanted to but due to my laziness I was like skipping stuffs.

I struggled a lot with TypeScript and stuff because I had a better understanding about the core languages like C, Python and Java where if you see TypeScript syntax is really weird I couldn't relate it with any of those core languages fully. I wanted more details on some concepts which were confusing to me so I did a research on with the help of Gen AI. When I was introduced to case studies I wondered how am I gonna handle those and afraid about it but with the detailed and proper explanation they provide with the case studies I feel like I can handle it smoothly than I expected.

More than the concepts I learned, this internship changed how I look at learning itself. At first, many things felt confusing and overwhelming, especially working with new concepts and case studies. But by showing up every day and staying consistent, even when I felt stuck, I slowly became more confident in handling things I didn’t fully understand. I realised that feeling confused is part of the learning process and consistency matters more than trying to be perfect. This mindset is something I want to carry forward even after this internship ends.
