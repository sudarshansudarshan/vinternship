Hello! This blog serves the purpose of reflecting upon the learning journey that I went through during the course of the first 3 weeks of my virtual internship under Vicharanasala (Lab for Education Design), Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar.

To begin with, I didn't _really_ buy into the idea that another online course was going to affect my nature of learning in any way. But fortunately, that wasn't the case. What truly hooked me was not the content itself, but the **method**. The content can be found on YouTube, but its presentation, and the way it retains attention, especially in the age of attention economy, made me re-evaluate my schedule and how I approach self-learning.

It made me think: should I quiz myself at regular intervals to retain knowledge? How can I apply this technique in my daily life? It’s safe to say I’ve encountered and overcome different challenges at various stages, each leaving me with valuable lessons

While working through the MERN Stack, the biggest challenge was the consistency. However, that was quickly resolved by the satisfaction I received from completing each section. I can honestly say that ViBe's lived up to its motto of "fully hands on learning through patience and persistence," hence delivering what it promised.

Sequentially, I realised that I didn't interact a lot in the live sessions held for us, and I sought to change that. One line from Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar stuck with me: "You should create your own spotlight" (Paraphrased). These words have been a quiet reminder that I carry with me every day, encouraging me to step forward and make my voice heard. And I'm sure that I'll be carrying these words with me way past the duration of my internship.

With that being said, I’m excited to see what the next 7 weeks bring.
