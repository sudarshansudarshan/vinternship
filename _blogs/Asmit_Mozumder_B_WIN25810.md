# My First Week in Pinternship: Confusion, Code, and a Little Chaos

The first week of Pinternship was… honestly a lot. Not in a bad way. Just a _brain-full_ kind of way (￣▽￣;).

When I joined, I thought, “Okay, MERN stack, cool, let’s go.” But then boom - loads of info, platforms, schedules, tools, meetings, names, and suddenly my brain was like: **sir this is a Wendy’s**.

Everything felt confusing at first. But in a strange way, that confusion was exciting too. Like standing in front of a huge map and not knowing where to look first.

## ViBe: From Buggy to Better

Let’s talk about ViBe. At the start, the website was… struggling. Laggy, buggy, things not loading properly, my patience loading slower than the site itself. 

There were moments when I refreshed the page more than I revised the concepts (｡•́︿•̀｡).

But by the end of the week? It improved by leaps and bounds. Things became smoother, more stable, and honestly much easier to use. That improvement was very noticeable and very welcome.

## JavaScript, TypeScript, and My Brain Cells

I completed the JS and TS parts on ViBe, and I’ll say this - it was actually very engaging. But also confusing at times. Sometimes I was like, “Oh yeah, I get this!” And two minutes later: “Wait… why is this not working?” 

Still, solving those small confusions felt really rewarding. It didn’t feel like just watching videos - it felt like actually doing something, even when I messed up.

## The AI Is Watching… Literally

One thing that really made me pay attention was the ViBe AI face and anomaly detection. Like bro, I can’t even zone out peacefully (⊙_⊙;). But honestly, it worked. It kept me focused, and somehow made the whole thing feel more serious and “real” than a normal online course.

## Standups: More Than Just Attendance

The standup meetings were mostly for notifications by the organisers, some quizzes, and useful information. They helped keep everyone on the same page and gave a clearer idea of what’s coming next. It wasn’t just “show up and leave” - there was always something small but important to take away.

## The Alumni Meeting

We had one meeting with the alumni, and that was genuinely fun. Hearing their experiences, how they went through similar confusion, and how things worked out for them later was oddly comforting. It made the journey feel less scary and more achievable (＾_＾).

## The People Behind It

I also want to mention the people and organisations that make this whole thing possible:

## Final Thoughts (for Week One at least)

This was just the first week, and yeah, it was messy, confusing, and a little overwhelming. But also exciting, engaging, and kind of addictive. I don’t fully understand everything yet. But I think that’s the point. Right now, I’m just trying to learn, mess up, fix things, and repeat. And honestly? I’m enjoying the process so far.

Let’s see what the next weeks bring.
