**I entered this internship with no expectations at all**. I didn't know anything ,what this internship is all about , what will happen , what I am going to do...
see, I just took the NPTEL course Python for my academic need .  I don't even know , that I will get a internship offer out of it . 

One day, a mail notification came on my phone ,when I was just scrolling instagram and wasting my time.
when I read the mail, I was surprised , but since it was my first ever internship offer,so I can't afford to loose it.**

I got into this internship with zero Knowledge as I said . I didn't even know that I will learn the so popular MERN stack and that too on a platform like VIBE..

SO ,if I talk about my learning journey so far , I obviously learned the few topics of MERN stack like typescript , react and right now also , I am learning Mongodb..

And most importantly ,  **if I talk about my Personality development, then I feel like I have become somewhat more confident and its because of the standup sessions , these sessions also forced me to come and talk infront of 450+ people , so my communication skills also improved.**

And because of this newly generated self-confidence , I joined Breakout rooms also ,  where I interacted with people from across India..

*so yeah, that was my internship experience till now , hope you will not find it boring !*
