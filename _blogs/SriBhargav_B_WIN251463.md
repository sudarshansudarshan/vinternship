There is a distinct difference between understanding code and becoming a developer. My journey with the VLED Lab has been the bridge between those two worlds.

I began by navigating the **MERN stack** modules on the **ViBe platform**. While building skills in JavaScript, React, and MongoDB felt like assembling a toolkit, it was **TypeScript** that changed how I see the "blueprints." Moving from the flexibility of JS to the strict, scalable patterns of TS was a challenge that required more than just memorization—it required a shift in logic.

The real growth, however, happened during the **case studies**. This wasn't about following a tutorial; it was about struggling with a problem until the solution felt earned. I realized that confusion isn't a sign of failure—it is simply the stage before clarity. By completing the case studies in TypeScript, I didn't just learn a language; I learned how to reason like a developer when the path isn't predefined.

Beyond the code, the **Daily Stand-ups** reshaped my professional confidence. Explaining my progress and admitting my "blockers" in front of mentors taught me that consistency and honesty are the backbone of any real project. 

This internship has trusted me to take my learning seriously even when nobody is watching, and that trust has changed how I show up to my screen every morning.
