This internship with IIT Ropar is actually my first-ever internship, and honestly, it already means a lot to me.

If I look back at myself a few weeks ago, I see someone who wanted to learn, wanted to grow, but kept postponing things. I had been wanting to learn the MERN stack for a long time, but between college, routine, and self-doubt, I never really gave myself the time or commitment it deserved. This internship came at the right moment, almost like a gentle push I didn’t know I needed.

When it started, I was genuinely excited. There was curiosity, a little nervousness, and a strong hope that this experience would help me grow, not just technically, but personally too. What I didn’t expect was how motivating it would feel to learn alongside people from different parts of the country, collaborate, share ideas, and grow together. It truly feels like being in the right place at the right time.

It’s been just 15 days, but I can already see a change in myself. Fifteen days ago, I had mixed feelings (uncertainty, hesitation, and a lot of “what ifs”). Today, I feel more disciplined, and more sure of my direction. I’ve started believing that consistency matters more than perfection, and that showing up every day really does make a difference.

This internship has made me more aware of my own potential and has encouraged me to take learning seriously, not out of pressure, but out of genuine interest and excitement. I’m now looking forward to the upcoming activities, challenges, and opportunities with a positive mindset and an eagerness to learn more.

Grateful for this journey so far, and excited for everything that’s yet to come.
