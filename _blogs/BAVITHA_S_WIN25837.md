I entered this internship without clarity, expectations, or a fixed plan.

What started as a simple academic decision—enrolling in an NPTEL course—unexpectedly turned into my first internship opportunity at IIT Ropar. When the selection mail arrived, it caught me completely off guard. I didn’t fully understand what lay ahead, but I knew I couldn’t let the opportunity slip.

Coming in with limited practical exposure, the learning curve felt steep at first. The internship introduced me to the MERN stack through the ViBe platform, and the experience was unlike any traditional learning setup I had encountered. Short concept-driven videos, frequent in-video questions, and AI-based proctoring made passive learning impossible. I had to stay present, think actively, and truly understand before moving forward.

Initially, this felt uncomfortable. But over time, I realized that this structure was shaping something more important than technical skills—discipline and consistency. Rewatching videos, revisiting concepts, and validating my understanding through quizzes helped build a strong foundation instead of surface-level knowledge.

Beyond individual learning, collaboration played a huge role. Breakout room discussions and case studies exposed me to diverse perspectives from peers across India. Explaining my thought process, listening to others, and collectively solving problems helped me grow faster than learning alone ever could.

The stand-up sessions were another turning point. Speaking in front of hundreds of participants pushed me far outside my comfort zone. Gradually, I noticed a shift—my confidence improved, my communication became clearer, and I felt more comfortable expressing my ideas publicly.

One thought shared during these sessions stayed with me: 

“Our network is our net worth.”

This internship helped me connect with motivated peers, mentors, and learners who are equally invested in growth.

What stood out most was that this experience wasn’t limited to coding. Reporting platform issues, tracking progress on leaderboards, and engaging with the cohort made me feel like an active contributor rather than just a learner.

Looking back, this internship arrived at a time when direction felt uncertain. It didn’t solve everything—but it gave structure, momentum, and proof that growth was happening.

I’m grateful to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar , Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, NPTEL , ANNAM.AI and Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design for creating an environment that encourages real learning, accountability, and self-improvement.

I’m looking forward to the coming weeks—continuing to learn, collaborate, and grow.
