I recently started my 10-week virtual internship through NPTEL at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , and it has been a meaningful and motivating experience so far. This internship has helped me learn new technical skills and also given me a chance to interact with peers from different backgrounds.

All our classes and learning activities are conducted through the ViBe platform where we can access well organized recorded sessions. The sessions focus on full-stack web development using the MERN stack, starting from the basics and gradually moving forward, which makes learning comfortable and effective.

In the initial phase, I've been revising JavaScript fundamentals and getting introduced to Typescript. This has helped me strengthen my foundation and better understand how modern web applications are built.

A key part of the internship is the standup sessions, where we share what we have learned, the challenges we faced, and what we plan to do next. These sessions help me improve the communication skills and build confidence while sharing the ideas.

Next, The Breakout sessions gives us an opportunity to interact in smaller groups. We discuss topics, clear doubts, and learn from each other's perspectives. These discussions make learning more interactive and enjoyable.

Overall, this internship has been a great learning journey so far. I'm grateful to NPTEL, IIT Ropar, and mentor team for this opportunity, and look forward to learn more and grow through this experience.

Special Thanks to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar , ANNAM.AI , VLED Labs, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar.
