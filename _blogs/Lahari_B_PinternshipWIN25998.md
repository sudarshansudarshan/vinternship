When I first learned that I had been selected for an internship at IIT Ropar, I was genuinely excited. It felt like the beginning of something meaningful — new learning, new people, and new challenges.

Two weeks into the internship, I’ve realized that this experience is shaping me in more ways than just academically. The environment is highly interactive and collaborative, which initially pushed me out of my comfort zone. As someone who usually prefers working quietly, I found myself hesitating at first. But I soon understood that this internship was also an opportunity to grow personally, not just technically.

Our journey began on the ViBe learning platform, where we started with the MERN stack through hands-on learning. This was followed by case studies that encouraged deeper thinking rather than quick answers. The breakout sessions that followed became an unexpected turning point. I started by listening, then slowly began to speak, and eventually felt comfortable sharing my thoughts. I even considered explaining concepts to others — a small but meaningful sign of growing confidence.

What has made these first two weeks truly impactful is the support system. The faculty foster an encouraging learning environment, and fellow interns make discussions feel approachable and inclusive.

With eight more weeks still ahead, these early experiences have already changed how I view learning and self-growth. I’m excited to continue building confidence, skills, and perspective as this journey unfolds.

Grateful for the journey so far, and looking forward to what’s next.
