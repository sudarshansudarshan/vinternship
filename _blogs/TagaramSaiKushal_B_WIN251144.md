When I started my Pinternship with VLED Lab, I honestly thought learning meant finishing tasks quickly and moving to the next one. I was more focused on progress that could be seen submissions, outputs, and ticking off checklists. But very soon, I realized that this experience was going to teach me something different.

There were many days when concepts didn’t click immediately. Sometimes my code didn’t work the way I expected, and the solution was not obvious at all. Earlier, I used to get frustrated when things took longer. But here, I slowly understood that struggling with a problem is not a waste of time — it’s actually part of learning.

Instead of rushing, I began revisiting the basics, reading again, and asking better questions. I learned that being consistent mattered more than being fast. Even small improvements, when done regularly, started building real understanding.
