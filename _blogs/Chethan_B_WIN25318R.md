# More Than an Internship, a Shift in Mindset  

I didn’t realise how much my approach to learning needed to change until this internship began. Being new to the MERN stack, I initially felt unsure and overwhelmed. I wasn’t lacking effort, but I was still figuring out how to truly learn instead of just keeping up. That realisation itself became the starting point of this journey. 

From the first week, learning through the ViBe platform felt different. The videos were short, almost like reels, and at the beginning, I struggled to concentrate. I rewound often, lost focus, and felt stuck. But over time, the structure pushed me to stay present. Each video ended with a short quiz, not to test memory, but to check attention. Slowly, I stopped watching just to move forward and started listening to understand. Without noticing it immediately, my focus improved and learning felt calmer and more effective 🎯

What added real depth to this experience were the insights shared by seniors from the founders’ batch like 
Himanshu P Dev , Amruta Pattanaik , Ahana Sarkar , JAISREE RAGAVI J and many others , shared stories were honest and grounded, especially about **fear and consistency**. 
*One story stayed with me deeply - a fearful deer may die of thirst, while a fearless one may die in the hands of a tiger. It made me reflect on how fear often limits us more than circumstances.*

Another line shared during the journey stayed with me: 
>"Nobody is a waste, none are good for nothing, and God does not create garbage". 

As the internship moved into case studies, learning became more practical. Concepts were explained through scenarios, followed by small challenges. Stand-up meets, peer learning, and breakout room discussions made learning feel shared rather than isolating.

Guidance from Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar , along with the efforts of the Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design team and mentors such as Meenakshi V , Nitin Sankar , Jinal Gupta , Sakshi Sharma , Nandan Prabhudesai , and Harshdeep R. , played an important role throughout this journey. I’m grateful to Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , ANNAM.AI , and the NPTEL and SWAYAM MHRD team, and to Bapuji Institute of Engineering & Technology, DAVANAGERE 🌱 This internship didn’t teach me to rush. It taught me to stay present, stay consistent, and trust the process ✨(give this as readme.md format)
