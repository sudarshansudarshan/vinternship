Growing Through Conversations and Code at IIT Ropar

Being selected for an internship at IIT Ropar was an exciting moment for me. Just two weeks in, I’ve realized that this experience is helping me grow not only technically, but personally as well.

The learning environment is open and discussion-based, which pushed me out of my comfort zone. I usually prefer listening more than speaking, but through regular interactions and breakout sessions, I slowly gained the confidence to share my thoughts.

We started with hands-on learning of the MERN stack on the ViBe platform, along with case studies that encouraged deeper thinking. Recently, we also registered for a two-phase hackathon, which gave us the chance to apply what we’ve learned, collaborate as a team, and think creatively.

The support from faculty and fellow interns has made this journey comfortable and motivating. With many weeks still ahead, I’m excited to continue learning, improving, and growing through this experience.

Grateful for the journey so far.
