I casually wrote the NPTEL Joy of Computing Using Python exam in my 3rd semester,
honestly without much thought. Most of my classmates were writing it, 
so I went along with them, not knowing that it would later open a door I never expected.

Months passed, and like many students, I began feeling confused and doubtful about myself.
I hadn’t landed any internships yet, and I wasn’t working on major projects like some of my peers. 
That phase of comparison and self-doubt was difficult. And then, unexpectedly, I received an email I
had been selected as an intern at IIT Ropar, all because I had written that NPTEL exam.

The First Week: Breaking My Expectations
Having attended online internships before, I didn’t have very high expectations for the live sessions.
I assumed it would be similar to recorded lectures with minimal interaction.
But from the very first week, this internship proved me wrong.

The live sessions felt almost like a real classroom. Over time, we could even recognize 
some of our peers just by seeing their names repeatedly something I never experienced in online programs before.

Sudarshan Iyengar Sir played a huge role in setting this atmosphere. He was extremely
supportive and constantly motivated us to step out of our comfort zones. 
The encouragement didn’t feel forced; it felt genuine.One of the first tasks we were given was 
to post about our first-week experience on LinkedIn. This was a big step for me because I wasn’t 
someone who posted regularly on LinkedIn. My profile was almost inactive. But through this internship, 
I shared my experience and to my surprise, my LinkedIn suddenly felt alive.

Breakout Sessions: Learning Beyond the Screen
Another important and unexpected part of this internship was the breakout sessions. 
Like most students, I was completely new to this concept and never imagined it would become such an inevitable part of the internship journey.

These sessions helped me clear my doubts more effectively. Sometimes, students explain concepts
better than teachers, and this was exactly the case here. Learning from peers, discussing problems openly,
and hearing different perspectives made the concepts much clearer.

The VIBE Platfrom
The VIBE platform is a unique part of this internship. Lectures were delivered through videos, 
and our understanding was regularly tested using quizzes.Initially, the platform faced technical 
issues and lagged a lot, which made me doubt whether I would be able to complete the course on time.
But the technical team addressed the issues within a few days, and after that, the experience improved significantly.

Now, I am able to complete my weekly deadlines as expected, which feels rewarding.

This internship has given me much more than technical knowledge. It has provided exposure to the
tech industry even before formally entering it. It pushed me to be more confident, consistent, 
and open to learning.As I move forward in this internship, I genuinely hope to continue learning
with the same enthusiasm and curiosity that I experienced during the first two weeks. 
I look forward to gaining more knowledge, improving my skills, and completing this internship on a strong and meaningful note.
