##### **Title:** Learning Beyond MERN stack

It all started with an email.



I received an email saying that Vicharanashala Labs, IIT Ropar was offering an internship opportunity for NPTEL top performers and I was left in disbelief.



I remember the big smile on my face while walking back from my HOD’s cabin after getting the NOC signed for this internship. I’m pretty sure the people around me thought I was mad for smiling to myself like that. At the same time, I was worried about not being shortlisted. My mind kept imagining all the possible negative outcomes. I knew things wouldn’t go that easy.



Somehow, I received my offer letter.



Then came the training phase. The training was planned for four weeks, but some people in my cohort completed it in just four days. That honestly demotivated me. I am new to the MERN stack, and I take time to understand things. Seeing others move so fast made me doubt myself.



But after listening to our seniors and the internship team, my perspective changed. 

I struggled to keep up with the pace, but I settled in with time. For me, this internship is not about how fast I complete tasks. It’s about how well I can understand the concepts and how much knowledge I gain along the way. 



At first, I thought I shouldn’t post anything online about this internship.  

But somehow, this internship led me to do it. And this article also.



Maybe it’s good for me because once everyone knows about it, I feel more responsible. It pushes me to work more seriously. There is a quiet pressure, the thought of being judged if I don't complete it successfully.



Since this is my first internship and I’ve never experienced anything like this before, I don’t aim to be at the top. I just want to learn something meaningful.



And that something makes this journey worth it for me.
