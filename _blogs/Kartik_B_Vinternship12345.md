A reflection on learning, collaboration, and trusting the process during my internship

On the first day of my internship at VLED Labs , I knew this wasn’t going to be a usual internship. Learning began on the ViBe platform with one-minute videos, the camera always on, and AI monitoring attention. If you looked away, the video paused. After every minute, there was a quiz and if you failed, you had to rewatch the content. What started as curiosity quickly turned into pressure.

That pressure grew with the leaderboard. At first, it felt motivating, but soon I realized I wasn’t learning to understand, I was learning just to not be left out. Speed and completion mattered more to me than clarity. The turning point came when I noticed that even people far ahead were still struggling to explain concepts properly. Around the same time, Rohit sir said something simple: don’t rush, focus on understanding. That made me stop and reflect on how I was actually learning.

I realized I was moving fast because I was scared of falling behind. So I made a decision that felt uncomfortable, I stopped checking the leaderboard and focused on my own pace. I started pausing videos, thinking more deeply, and asking questions instead of rushing ahead. It wasn’t easy, and I did worry that slowing down might cost me later. But the results spoke for themselves: fewer quiz reattempts, clearer understanding while coding, and more confidence in case studies.

What surprised me was how engaging learning became after that. I built a personal, customized dashboard that clearly showed progress and next goals, which made learning feel less vague and more intentional. At the same time, constant discussions with peers made learning collaborative. One random morning standup even led to us creating a Discord server for Vinternship together. By the end of the day, people who were strangers in the morning felt like teammates.

Before this internship, pressure pushed me toward shortcuts i.e. searching for answers instead of truly understanding the problem. This experience made me unlearn that habit. More than the tools or technology, what stayed with me was this lesson: Understanding the process matters far more than rushing to reach the solution.
