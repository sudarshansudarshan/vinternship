It has only been two weeks since I started this internship, but it already feels like a small turning point in how I look at learning.

In the beginning, I was honestly confused. There were documents to read, platforms to explore, and so many things happening at once. I spent the first few days just figuring out where everything was and how the system worked. Getting used to the ViBe platform itself felt like a task before even starting the actual learning.

Then came the MERN stack.

JavaScript, TypeScript, React, MongoDB, Express — all new, all together, and all moving fast. Since this was my first time learning the MERN stack, it felt overwhelming at moments. Some concepts took time to make sense, and I had to rewatch and retry things more than once.

What made it harder was seeing that some of my peers had completed the course in just a week. Without realizing it, I started measuring myself using numbers and speed instead of understanding. That feeling of “I’m behind” slowly started creeping in.

But something important happened here.

Our mentors never compared us based on how fast we completed the course. Instead, they kept reminding us that this internship is about learning, not racing. That changed how I looked at everything. I realized I didn’t join this program to compete with others — I joined it to actually understand new technologies and grow as a developer.

So I slowed down.

I started learning at a pace that worked for me. I paid more attention to concepts instead of just finishing tasks. And surprisingly, things started making more sense. The pressure reduced, and curiosity came back.

This experience taught me that consistency matters more than speed. Progress doesn’t always look impressive on charts, but it feels real when you finally understand something that confused you before.

Even though it’s still early in the internship, I already feel more confident about learning new tech, asking questions, and trusting my own process. I know there’s a lot more to come — projects, teamwork, challenges — and I’m actually excited for it instead of scared.

More than just technical skills, this internship is teaching me how to learn better, how to stay patient with myself, and how to focus on growth instead of comparison. And honestly, that lesson might be just as important as learning the MERN stack itself.
