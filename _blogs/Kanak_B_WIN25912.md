When I first started exploring the tech space, the **MERN stack** was something I never felt drawn to. It always seemed like “something everyone does”, and that perception alone made it feel uninteresting to me. I never gave it a fair chance. Somewhere in my head, I had already decided that it wasn’t for me.

That perspective changed when I began my **Winter Internship (named Pinternship)** at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar**, under the guidance of **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar**.

One of the biggest reasons for this shift has been the **ViBe learning platform**. For the first time, MERN felt approachable. I had never come across a learning resource that explained the MERN stack in such a **clear and structured manner**. Concepts that once felt overwhelming and dull suddenly started making sense. Learning felt easier not because the subject is simple, but because it was finally presented the right way.

The internship itself follows a **three-phase structure — learning, case studies, and project building**. Knowing that learning will eventually translate into analysis and then into building something real adds a sense of purpose. It’s challenging, and honestly, a little intimidating, but in a good way of course. It pushes you to stay consistent and accountable.

Beyond technical learning, this internship has impacted me in ways I didn’t expect:

- Interacting with fellow interns helped me understand where others are in their journeys. Seeing different learning speeds, mindsets, and approaches has increased my social awareness and given me a wider perspective on people and growth.
- One of the most personal changes I’ve noticed is in how I manage my time. The structure and expectations of the internship made me start respecting time more. I’ve consciously reduced distractions, spent less time on my phone, and become more mindful of how I use my day. That shift alone feels like a quiet but significant win.

This internship has taught me something important: 

> **Sometimes we dismiss paths not because they lack value, but because we haven’t experienced them the right way.**

With the right structure and guidance, even something once ignored can become deeply meaningful.

I’m grateful to NPTEL, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar, Nandan Prabhudesai sir and the teams involved in creating this learning environment. I’m looking forward to the next phases of this internship—and to continuing this journey of learning, reflection, and growth.
