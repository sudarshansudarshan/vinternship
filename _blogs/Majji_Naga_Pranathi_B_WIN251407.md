This blog is being written after completing one full week of learning at the Pinternship, and it already feels important enough to pause and reflect.

Before it started, I had waited for this internship for quite a long time. When it finally began, I expected the usual—platform walkthroughs, dashboards, FAQs, and tools. I assumed the first few sessions would explain how things work. Instead, they focused on something entirely different: how we work.

From the very beginning, the emphasis was not on features or technology, but on mindset—consistency, participation, discipline, and being fully present. That caught me off guard. I remember feeling unsure of where I stood and what exactly was expected of me. But that uncertainty slowly revealed something intentional. This internship was designed to make us reflect before it made us perform.

Pinternship stands for Parallel Internship, and over this week, that idea has unfolded more deeply for me. It isn’t only about doing an internship alongside college. It’s about learning how to manage responsibility, time, and focus without being spoon-fed. Nothing here is aggressively enforced, yet everything quietly holds you accountable.

One detail that stood out to me was that even the names in this ecosystem carry meaning. ViBe, the learning platform, stands for Vikram Betal. Much like the stories it draws inspiration from, learning here constantly pauses you, questions you, and nudges you to think before moving forward. It made the experience feel intentional rather than mechanical.

Seniors repeatedly mentioned that this internship would gradually pull us away from mindless scrolling. I was sceptical at first. But within a few days, I noticed a shift. Without consciously trying, I became more focused. I found myself checking my progress, my leaderboard position, and my health points. Consistency stopped feeling forced and started feeling natural.

The introduction of health points, in particular, changed my behaviour. Small things—being present, engaging actively, keeping the camera on—suddenly mattered. It made me more aware of how I show up, not just whether I show up. I can honestly say that I have never been this focused and concentrated on learning before.

Learning through ViBe itself has been refreshing. The video-based courses encourage understanding rather than passive consumption. The attentiveness checks and quizzes surprised me—in a good way. Alongside this, the case studies pushed me to confront the gap between knowing something and applying it. They weren’t easy, and that was the point. They demanded thinking, not memorisation.

Although Professor Sudarshan Iyengar is not directly teaching the MERN stack, his presence is felt throughout the internship. What stood out to me was not specific instructions or lectures, but the way conversations were framed. Instead of giving answers, he often guided us to think. There was a recurring emphasis on long-term value over short-term comfort, and that perspective quietly stayed with me even after the sessions ended.

"Penny-wise and pound-foolish."

Interacting with seniors added another layer of clarity. Listening to their experiences—what challenged them, what they struggled with, and how they grew—made the journey ahead feel more real and grounded. Peer learning here isn’t an add-on; it’s part of how growth happens.

What I am gaining from this internship already feels lasting—discipline, focus, and a more intentional relationship with learning. It is intense, yes—but it is also meaningful.

Looking back at just this one week, I can already see a shift in how I approach learning. I’m more aware of my habits, more honest about my effort, and more deliberate with my time. This feels less like an internship and more like a turning point.

And if this is only the first week, I’m genuinely curious—and quietly excited—about what lies ahead.

Grateful for the guidance from Sudarshan Iyengar, VLED Lab team and mentors at IIT Ropar.
