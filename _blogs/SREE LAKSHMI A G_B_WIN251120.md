January 12th, 2026 – the day that changed everything.
I had applied for the NPTEL Winter Internship 2025 at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , and like countless other aspiring students, I found myself obsessively refreshing my inbox. An internship at an IIT isn't just an opportunity; it's a dream that feels almost too big to achieve. When that email finally arrived, I could have jumped to the sky. I was in.
My excitement was soon accompanied by nervousness. The inaugural session was scheduled for January 15th, 2026. My mind raced with questions: What would the team expect from us? How would the internship unfold? How would I compete with 500 brilliant minds in the cohort? Would I be able to keep up with the pace? Did I truly belong here among such talented peers? Self-doubt crept in, but so did determination.
When Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir addressed us during the inaugural session, something shifted. He shared wisdom that would shape my entire journey. One concept struck a chord: the strength of weak ties.
This reminded me that growth doesn't always come from our closest circles but often from unexpected connections and diverse perspectives. It was a powerful reminder that this internship wasn't just about competition – it was about collaboration, learning, and expanding my network.
Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir also emphasized something crucial: stay glued to the screen, stay focused. This internship became my antidote to doom scrolling that had consumed so much of my time before.
Our learning platform was Vibe AI, he likened it to the famous Indian tale of 
Vikram and Betal – where Betal would perch on Vikram's shoulder, and Vikram couldn't turn around or speak, or Betal would fly away.
Similarly, Vibe AI demands complete attention. No turning away, no distractions – just pure, focused learning. It's designed to keep you engaged, present, and accountable. This approach has genuinely helped me break free from the endless scroll and redirect my energy toward meaningful learning. The platform doesn't just teach; it transforms how you engage with knowledge.
I never imagined connecting with co-interns from across India in an online internship – hearing them sharing experiences in standups, and learning together was such a new experience.
Having G.Joyce Arpana , Deepak Mahajan , and Jaganath in the breakout sessions to solve case studies was truly a blast. We helped each other solve doubts and genuinely supported one another's learning .It was collaborative in the truest sense – no competition, just collective growth. Every question was met with patience, every struggle with encouragement.
Then came the moment that truly brought Professor Sudarshan sir's words to life. When I was looking to form a hackathon team, I reached out to my co-interns Nikhil Raghuwanshi and Mithra S – people I'd never spoken to before. They had already formed their team, yet they helped me build mine. These were essentially strangers who went out of their way to support me.
That's when it hit me: the strength of weak ties.
I understood it intellectually before, but experiencing it is entirely different. These connections – with people I barely knew, from places I'd never been – became some of the most valuable relationships in my journey. They helped when they had no obligation to.They collaborated when they could have simply focused on their own goals.
I didn't just understand the concept anymore. I felt it. I lived it.
My heartfelt gratitude to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir and his exceptional team – Meenakshi V mam, Nitin Sankar sir, Jinal Gupta mam, Harshdeep R. mam, Nandan Prabhudesai sir, Bhavana mam, Sakshi Sharma mam, and all the dedicated individuals working behind the scenes.
"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." This internship has proven that collaboration isn't just a strategy – it's the foundation of extraordinary growth.
