I am currently pursuing my **NPTEL Winter Internship** at **IIT Ropar** under the guidance of **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar**. When I started this journey, I had a clear academic goal: master the MERN stack. Today, I can proudly say I have achieved **100% completion** of the ViBe course, covering JavaScript, TypeScript, React, MongoDB, and Express.

However, as I progressed in the course, the platform taught me something much more valuable than just technical skills. The real takeaway is how this internship is changing my work habits.

The ViBe course, where our tutor **Nandan Prabhudesai** guides us through the stack, offered a learning experience I had never encountered before. The platform has a unique constraint: I have to keep my eyes on the screen. If I look away—even for a moment—the video restarts from the beginning.

At first, this was challenging. But over time, it developed into a habit. It forced me to stop being distracted by my surroundings. This constraint has now become a reflex. Even outside of internship work, I find myself maintaining that same level of undivided attention. I am not just learning to code; I am learning the discipline of deep work.

Now that I am moving from tutorials to **Case Studies**, I am facing a necessary reality check. While the course gave me the knowledge, the case studies are giving me the practice.

These aren't just assignments; they are practical ways to test the strength of my concepts. They reflected my weak points immediately. Identifying these gaps has been crucial. It shifted my focus from just "getting it done" to targeting my weaknesses specifically to become a better software engineer.

Above all, this journey is not solitary. The mentorship has been excellent, providing guidance whenever the path gets unclear.

Between the daily **Standup sessions**, the intensive **Weekend sessions**, and the collaborative **Breakout rooms** on Zoom, I have learned that engineering is a team sport. These interactions are keeping the momentum going and have turned a virtual internship into a connected community.

I am looking forward to keeping this momentum going in the upcoming weeks and carrying these habits forward even after the internship ends.
