When I first started this online internship with the VLED Lab, I did not really have a plan. I was curious, a little nervous, and unsure of what to expect. I kept wondering whether I would be able to stay disciplined while working remotely and whether I would actually understand the material or just complete tasks without really learning.

As the internship continues, I am slowly learning how to slow down. In an online setting, it is very easy to rush through content, but I am becoming more comfortable sitting with ideas that do not make sense right away. At first, feeling stuck was frustrating. Now, I am starting to see it as part of the learning process rather than a problem.

Even though everything is remote, the routine of regular check-ins and stand-ups gives my weeks some structure. Some days feel productive, and others feel messy or unorganized, but I am realizing that showing up on those off days matters just as much. That consistency is slowly changing how I approach my work and learning.

This internship is also helping me become more patient with myself. The environment feels supportive, which makes it easier to ask questions instead of rushing to find the right answers. The progress may not always be obvious, but it feels real.

So far, this experience has been meaningful for me. I am grateful to the VLED Labs and Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar for creating a learning space that feels honest and human, even across a screen.
