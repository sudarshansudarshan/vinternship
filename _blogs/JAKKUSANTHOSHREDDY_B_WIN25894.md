title: "Beyond the Syllabus: My Transformation at VLED Lab"

I used to think learning was about how fast you could finish a syllabus. But my time at IIT Ropar’s VLED Lab taught me otherwise. It wasn't just an internship; it was a slow, steady transformation in how I think, moving away from just "getting it done" to truly understanding the "why" behind the code.

The Shift to True Ownership
When I started on the ViBe platform, I expected the typical academic routine: follow the steps, check the boxes, and move to the next module. Instead, I was met with something I wasn't used to: full responsibility. Without a teacher or manager pushing me daily, I had to find my own rhythm. At first, that freedom was uncomfortable. It forced me to stop relying on external pressure and start relying on my own discipline.

Decoding the Difficulty
The MERN stack has its challenges—TypeScript can be stubborn, and backend logic doesn't always click on the first try. But the biggest hurdle wasn't the syntax; it was my own reaction to being "stuck." In the past, I saw confusion as proof that I wasn’t good enough. This internship changed that. I started seeing confusion as a necessary signal to slow down and dig deeper. I learned that the best engineering happens when you stop rushing and start observing.

From Tasks to Trade-offs
The case studies were where things got real. There wasn't a single "correct" answer waiting at the end of the day. I had to make actual decisions, weigh the trade-offs, and get comfortable with uncertainty. For the first time, I wasn't just completing assignments—I was making engineering decisions. Sharing this journey with others in the program made it even better. Realizing that everyone else was also navigating their own messy, imperfect learning curve made the process feel less like a competition and more like a community.

The Lasting Impact
I’m finishing this program with a lot more than just knowledge of React, Express, and MongoDB. I’m leaving with patience. I’ve developed a far deeper respect for consistency than for speed.

VLED Lab trusted me to take my own learning seriously even when no one was watching. That trust didn't just give me technical skills; it gave me a mindset of accountability that I know will stay with me for the rest of my career.

Sincere thanks to VLED Labs Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design ANNAM.AI NPTEL Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar for this wonderful oppurtunity.
