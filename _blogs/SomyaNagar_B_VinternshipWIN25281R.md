It has been almost three weeks since I started my internship at IIT Ropar under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir. This internship has given me a learning experience that feels very different from what I was used to earlier. Instead of rushing to complete tasks, the focus here is on understanding concepts properly and learning through practice.

One of the most important parts of this internship is the ViBe learning platform. The videos are very short, but they require full attention. You cannot watch them casually or while doing something else. At first, it felt a bit strict, but slowly I realized it was helping me stay focused and actually understand what I was learning instead of just watching videos for the sake of completion.

Along with the course, I have been working on case studies, especially in TypeScript. These case studies do not give direct answers. They make you think, plan, and write code on your own. Even when it feels difficult, solving them helps concepts stay in mind much better.

The standup meetings became one of my favorite parts of the internship. Everyone shares what they worked on and what they learned. The environment is always positive, and listening to others motivates me to stay consistent.

We also have breakout sessions, where interns from different backgrounds come together to discuss doubts and solve case studies problems. These sessions helped me understand different ways of thinking and made learning feel less stressful and more collaborative.

So far, I have completed the ViBe course. One big lesson I have learned is the importance of consistency. Even when progress feels slow, showing up every day really helps.

Three weeks are done, and there is still a long way to go. This internship is helping me become more patient with learning and reminding me that learning is a process, not a race.
