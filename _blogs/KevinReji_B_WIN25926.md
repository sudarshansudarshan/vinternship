When the Pinternship began, I thought I knew what learning looked like.
Listen, write things down, finish the given tasks and move on. What I didn't expect was to feel uncomfortable in such a productive way.
There were moments when I caught myself waiting for clear instructions, only to realize that none were coming.
At first, that unsettles me. I doubted whether I was doing it right, but slowly, the same uncertainty became the point. 
I realized that learning here wasn't about reaching the correct answer quickly, but about sitting with questions long enough to let better thinking emerge.
What stayed with me the most was how often I had to unlearn habits I didn't even know I had. The urge to rush. 
The assumption that learning must always feel smooth. Instead, the progress showed up silently. One surprising shift was how I started listening differently, 
not to just to mentors but to myself. I noticed patterns in how I approached problems, where I hesitated and where I avoided depth, 
The Pinternship held a mirror to my learning progress.
For someone who has never experienced learning in this way, I would say that, Pinternship doesn't try to fill you with the information, 
but it creates space for you to think, reflect and grow on your own terms. And once you experience that, it's hard to go back to learning the old way.
