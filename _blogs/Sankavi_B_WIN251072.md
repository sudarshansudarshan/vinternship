I never thought that I would learn the MERN stack, but this NPTEL Winter internship proved me wrong. It didn’t just teach me a technology—it taught me how to learn.


Like many others, I believed an internship was mainly about doing a project and clearing doubts related to it. I thought learning would happen automatically through that process. But this internship was completely different. Concepts were taught step by step, just like the way I learned in school, which made the learning experience structured and effective.


In the beginning of the course, I noticed that many students completed 25% of the Vibe on the very first day, and some even finished the entire MERN stack in just a week. Seeing this made me lose hope, and I started thinking that I didn’t fit into this internship. However, during the stand-up sessions, when everyone shared their experiences, I realized that I was not alone. Hearing Sudarshan sir say that reaching the top rank is not important, but truly understanding the concepts is what matters, changed my mindset. From that moment, I started working with confidence.


One major change this internship brought into my life was consistency. Before this, I was not consistent at all. During the initial days of the Vibe, there were days when I completed nearly 10%, and on other days, I couldn’t even cross 2%. This made me feel discouraged. But slowly, just like a small bird learning to fly—with many ups and downs—I learned how to be consistent. This journey taught me that progress doesn’t have to be perfect; it just has to continue.


The stand-up sessions kept me motivated and hopeful. That never allowed me to fall back. Whenever I felt demotivated, listening to other students share their struggles and growth motivated me to move forward.


The case studies also played a very important role in my journey. They acted as a recap of everything I learned in the Vibe sessions and pushed me to implement the concepts practically. Because of this hands-on approach, the concepts stayed with me, and this is something I will never forget.


The breakout rooms were another valuable part of this internship. Through them, I was able to communicate with students from different parts of the country, Understanding their perspectives on learning and solving case studies together also helped in building meaningful connections and friendships.


Through this internship, I unknowingly learned a lot. I learned how to study effectively, how to explain concepts clearly to others, and the importance of consistency. Most importantly, this internship helped me understand myself better—my pace, my strengths, and my ability to grow. This journey will always remain a meaningful part of my learning life.
