Rethinking MERN — My Learning Experience During My Internship

When I first came across the MERN stack, I didn’t feel particularly drawn to it. It seemed like one of those technologies everyone was working on, and that assumption alone made me overlook it without really exploring it in depth.

That changed during my Winter Internship with IIT Ropar through NPTEL.

A major reason for this shift was the ViBe learning platform we used during the program. The learning format was very different from traditional long lectures. Concepts were delivered through short 1–2 minute videos, each followed by quick and engaging quiz questions. This approach made learning feel active and focused. Instead of passively watching, I had to think and respond after every concept.

Because the lessons were broken into small, clear segments, topics that once felt complicated became easier to understand. The structure kept me interested, and I ended up completing the entire module in just five days because it held my full attention.

The leaderboard feature was another highlight. Being able to see my standing in real time added motivation and encouraged consistent effort. It introduced a healthy sense of competition that pushed me to stay engaged.

The internship itself follows a structured path from learning to case studies and project building. Knowing that theory would directly connect to practical work gave more meaning to the learning process. It required discipline, but it also made the progress feel real.

Beyond technical skills, this experience helped me become more mindful about how I use my time. The focused format naturally reduced distractions and unnecessary screen time, helping me stay more present while studying.

This internship taught me that sometimes our initial judgments about a field are shaped by perception rather than experience. With the right structure and guidance, even something we once overlooked can become genuinely interesting and valuable.
