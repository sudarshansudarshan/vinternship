When I started the Virtual Internship at IIT Ropar, I genuinely believed that learning about development would be all about doing the work, watching videos, and just progressing every week. But now that I have finished the first two weeks of this 10-week experience, I can confidently say that it has already been much more than that. It’s not just a learning experience; it’s an experience of developing discipline and learning to adjust to new challenges with the right mindset.

The first week began with video lectures on the MERN stack on the Vibe platform, and it felt remarkably different. The platform was protected by AI-based proctoring, and merely looking at another face would automatically rewind the video. The videos were short, lasting about 1 to 1.5 minutes, but after each video, there was a quiz that ensured the learning process remained active and challenging. It was tiring at first, as I had only reached about 5% of the overall progress in the first two days, with many others already moving ahead on the leaderboard. Instead, it was a wake-up call for me. I understood that it is consistent effort that beats the initial rush, and I was able to complete the entire module in a week.

 In addition to this, we conducted daily stand-up meetings, which were led by Sudarshan Sir, and these were extremely enlightening. Each of these meetings brought something new to the table, and the motivation provided by Sudarshan Sir was instrumental in keeping us motivated and engaged throughout. The internship program also conducted interaction meetings with students from previous batches who had already completed the program. Hearing out their experiences, advice, and learnings helped me make sense of the entire process and provided me with a clearer understanding of how I should approach the coming weeks.

The second phase of the program, which deals with case studies, has been one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had so far. What made this experience even more exciting was the fact that we conducted these in breakout rooms, where we were divided into groups consisting of students from different parts of the country. This made the experience of working together, discussing solutions, and learning from each other’s perspectives far more interesting than working alone. It was truly a sense of being part of a community of learners who were all growing together, and I enjoyed interacting with so many people through these sessions.

These first two weeks have been extremely eventful, with a lot of learning, challenges, and experiences. I look forward to what the coming weeks have in store for me—more problem-solving, more learning, and hopefully, more fun ahead.
