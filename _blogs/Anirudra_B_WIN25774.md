When the internship mail first arrived, I was genuinely excited to get the opportunity to intern at an IIT, yet slightly apprehensive, as I was new to MERN and had a sense of FOMO about being directly assigned to a project alongside more experienced fellow interns.

That apprehension faded during the inaugural session itself when Sudarshan Iyengar Sir said, “Learn before you do.” Everything is designed to start from scratch, and that completely changed my perspective.

The learning happens through the ViBe platform, where concepts are broken down into several nearly 1.5-minute shorts, followed by quizzes, with AI-proctoring enabled and explained using real-world analogies. Interestingly, the name ViBe doesn’t come from “Vibe Coding” — it’s inspired by the age-old Vikram–Betal stories. Lack of concentration during a lesson, detected by AI, requires starting again from the beginning, just like King Vikramaditya had to restart his journey for any misstep. It subtly trains discipline and presence.

The real challenge so far has been the Case Studies. Applying the concepts to real-world problems enables you to think, design, and apply, and that’s where engineering truly begins. This gives rise to breakout room discussions, which naturally turn collaborative, bringing together peers from different cultures and regions of the country, people we had never met before. It actually reflects the Unity in Diversity of India — something we’ve only read about in books, but are now experiencing firsthand.

Two weeks down, and the next eight weeks promise to be more exciting yet challenging, with the completion of learning modules and case studies, followed by project work. Onwards and upwards from here.

Thanks and gratitude to NPTEL and the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar for this great opportunity, also to the supporting organizations Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design and ANNAM.AI for their continuous support. 

Thanks to Sudarshan Iyengar Sir and the team of mentors including Sakshi Sharma Ma'am, Meenakshi V Ma'am, Rohit Sharma Sir, Nandan Prabhudesai Sir, Jinal Gupta Ma'am, Nitin Sankar Sir.

Special thanks to our seniors from the Founders Keepers batch, Himanshu P Dev, PRATHEEK G, Amruta Pattanaik, Ahana Sarkar, and others for their continuous support whenever needed.
