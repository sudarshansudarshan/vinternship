"500 students. One lab. A bold experiment in learning."

A familiar line to many of us. But this line got me thinking, what is this bold experiment? Why does an average scorer such as myself get a chance to be among the toppers from universities across all over India? 

Am I the one witnessing this experiment or am I the experiment?

Let's go back a month ago, when a girl who had nothing but time to spend recieved  an internship opportunity from NPTEL. 

Procrastination Case 1
My initial thoughts were why bother to fill when I am not going to get selected anyways. On top of that my procrastinated mindset kept whispering back, there are too many procedures to follow, to many students willing to take part, better than you, much deserving than you. Let it go already. Close enough, I was going to let it go if not my father had not been behind me to fill it up every minute till deadline.

Eventually I did end up filling the form and two days later I got my offer letter. 

Procrastination Case 2
I made a New Year Resolution this time, that I will be active on linkedin. I will finally make that one post, that will show my face to the world of networking. Since it was my first post, I wanted it to be something new, something never seen before, something creative, soemthing jaw-dropping, something awe-strucking, something appreciated.

But I had so many ideas at once, I was again stuck as to where to begin from?

How do I make my post engaging? How can it be eye-catching? and again goes those trail of thoughts.

Progress Phase 1
When I joined the internship, I expected the team to just bombard us with projects, after all it's not just a collage, it's THE IIT. But I was soon corrected when we were asked to learn before executing and execute before finishing. The once low self- esteem person, now had the chance to learn and grow with everyone at their own pace.

Have you ever been to a gym?

Ever heard of gym buddies? So as far as I understand, these people help you motivate throughout your gym session, help you push your limits and the next minute you realize- Holy moly, did I just hit a new PR?

The internship provided me this kind of support. I used to watch videos for my exams, to learn something but I never really gave it a second watch. I always found that part boring. I always ended up forgetting everything I had watched after my exams. In this internship too, we were provided video lectures. This time, I did not just watched, I understood and if I didnt I watched it till I understood.

I love playing car simulation games. Just like the leaderboard in those games provided me with an exhileration to be my best, the leaderboard this vinternship provided also filled me with the same heart racing excitment. The videos got so addictive that I could pull of an all nighter without forgetting what I learnt.

I was able to complete my course in just a week or so. After completing, I felt this sense of enlightenment that I finally know things, I can communicate to my fellow developers, I have crossed that first step. There was somehting in my mind that said, you can still do it.

Progress Phase 2
An internship is a profesional learning experience that offers meaningful, practical work related to a person’s field of study or career interest, as said on net. It should enhance one's journey when a student is just about to complete their studies and move to the real industry. However, it is often observed that a company or place offering intership already has a list of pre-requisites, a list of eligibility that includes skills that are thought during training.

To be in a race of getting a job, especially in a country with billions of job seekers and youth, one can be easily broken with multiple rejections. At the end one breaks and as rightfully said by Mr. Dananjaya Hettiarachchi in his award winning speech,' I See Something'- 

When you’re broken, it’s very difficult to feel special.

It's difficult to get on a race track in a long race, when you feel you are already way behind.

Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar  and his team including- Meenakshi V ma'am, Sakshi Sharma ma'am, Jinal Gupta ma'am, Nitin Sankar sir, Nandan Prabhudesai sir, Rohit Sharma sir, Harshdeep R. ma'am, and Bhavna ma'am were able to bring me out and piece me back together. In this journey, the previous interns, our now seniors, and the interns working along my side have also provided me with enough fuel to get back on the race track.

I do not know what the experiment is, but being a part of this internship has helped me find back my love to learn, my zeal to grow and helped me move on from the destructive mind of a procrastinator to a mind who focuses on progress. I finally made a post, it may have not been the best but it probably will not be my last.

This is just the beginning, changing habits takes time, changing a lazy midset takes time but nothing will happen if one does not even take their first step.
