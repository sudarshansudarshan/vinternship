My internship experience at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar has been truly good and rewarding. Being part of the same program, I’ve had the chance to learn, collaborate, and grow in ways that go beyond just technical skills.

The journey unfolded in three phases, each shaping my perspective and abilities:

1. MERN Course on ViBe

The first phase involves completing a structured MERN stack course on ViBe, an innovative online learning platform developed at IIT Ropar. ViBe makes learning interactive through short videos and quizzes, ensuring that concepts like MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js are not only understood but also applied effectively.

2. Case Studies

The second phase focuses on solving case studies, which simulate real-world scenarios and encourage us to apply MERN concepts in practical contexts. These case studies are often discussed in breakout sessions on Zoom, where we collaborate with co-interns, share ideas, and solve problems together. This interactive format sharpens problem-solving skills and builds teamwork.

3. Project Solving

The final phase is project solving, where we work on end-to-end projects that integrate all the skills learned. This stage is particularly exciting because it allows us to build complete applications, mirroring industry-level challenges and solutions.

Daily Stand-ups and Breakout Sessions

An important part of this internship is the daily stand-up meetings on Zoom. Every day, we interact with Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and our fellow co-interns. These sessions provide guidance, clarify doubts, and foster collaboration. Alongside stand-ups, the Zoom breakout sessions give us the chance to work closely with peers on case studies, making the learning process highly engaging and collaborative.

Looking back, this internship wasn’t just about the technical stuff. It really helped me grow in terms of confidence and adaptability too. Each phase had something different to teach me—whether it was structured learning, working together with a team, or taking the lead on a project. Altogether, it’s been a journey that shaped me into someone more capable and motivated for what’s ahead.
