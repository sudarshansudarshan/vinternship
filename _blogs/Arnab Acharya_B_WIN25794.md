Warm greetings to all. I’m writing this blog as a small slice of my journey so far in the Pinternship, a space that has already challenged and stretched me in ways I didn’t fully expect.

When I joined, I was prepared for tough competition—but I still underestimated it. Seeing my name on a leaderboard unlocked a side of me I didn’t know existed. I suddenly cared, a lot, about every mark, every milestone, every slip. Everyone here is an NPTEL topper, and as a first-year, it felt a bit overwhelming to realise that most others are probably in their third or fourth year. That gap in experience was intimidating, and the idea of milestones and penalties honestly scared me. I kept wondering, “Will I fall behind? Will I mess this up?” So far, I’ve managed not to cross any red lines, and that in itself feels like a small personal win.

There were also moments that frustrated me. Early on, the AI proctoring wasn’t fully active, and it was hard not to notice that some people seemed to be exploiting that. It bothered me, because I came into this wanting a fair, honest challenge. But then I realised that this, too, is part of real life: systems are imperfect, people make their own choices, and I can only control my own integrity and effort. That shift in mindset helped me refocus on my own work instead of constantly comparing.

The case studies have been one of the most eye-opening parts of the journey. They pushed me beyond what was covered in the ViBe videos and forced me to solve problems I had never seen before. Even something as “simple” as getting Visual Studio Code set up properly exposed gaps in my understanding. I hadn’t learned those details from ViBe, so I had to struggle a bit, search, ask, and experiment. That struggle is where I actually started to feel like a developer, not just a course student.

The [VLED Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dledlabs?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAFj1A3ABn0lNYCtWYzBKKfvS7IL76r9F15A) faculty (including [Rohit Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imrohitvk?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAADdQK4EBE9LtNDe5yDjOMw7Q7AowIDrwMSw) Sir, [Sakshi Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sakshivk?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAABJ1YxMBGvWvjPpN8TO3g_jmCYEITWjfrgI) Ma'am, [Meenakshi V](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABOOqOYBW2uHpKUV4uljUmF3lPfbmFXGE-Y?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAABOOqOYBW2uHpKUV4uljUmF3lPfbmFXGE-Y) Ma'am) have played a huge role in this experience. They are extremely professional, yet genuinely empathetic. You can feel that they care about how you learn, not just what you submit. Because of that, I’ve developed this strange habit before sleeping: I feel uneasy if I don’t watch ViBe on a given day. It has become part of my routine. At the same time, I know my consistency is still pretty low. I’m not where I want to be yet, but this internship has made me believe that I can get there.

One of the best parts of this journey so far has been the network I’ve started building. In just about two weeks, my LinkedIn connections grew from 14 to 116! These aren’t random numbers to me. Each connection represents someone who is also trying, learning, experimenting, and growing in their own way. It feels like I’ve been dropped into a community where being serious about learning is normal—and that’s incredibly motivating.
Above all, I feel genuinely grateful to have the privilege of interning under Prof. [Sudarshan Iyengar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACMTgvIBVZKXG37I7SojYUBw_R_ktaZtwfU?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAACMTgvIBVZKXG37I7SojYUBw_R_ktaZtwfU) and being part of this ecosystem. To anyone in a future cohort who might be reading this: this is not just another line on your CV. It’s an experience you can be deeply proud of.
