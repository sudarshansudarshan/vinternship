# Two Weeks into My First Internship 🪜
The first week was packed with tasks—acknowledging new tools, learning processes, and getting introduced to ViBe during the very first stand-up session. Many terms were unfamiliar to me, and for a moment, I reconsidered my decision to join.

But as the days went on, and after listening to Sudarshan Sir, I realized something important: we should attempt the impossible until our hard work, consistency, and accuracy make it possible.

# Stand-ups [Cameras On]
These gatherings were not just about listening—they gave us space to express our thoughts too. Tech discussions, knowledge sharing, discipline, and teaching—all in one place.

The meetings ended, but the learning continued to grow.

# ViBe: Vikram Betaal
ViBe is a learning platform where we study the MERN Stack. And we weren’t alone—our companion, the AI Proctoring System, was always there to catch us red-handed.

From being buggy to becoming smart, the journey was full of challenges. The courses had back-to-back quizzes, which really helped in reinforcing what we learned.

# My Hack Story _____
Initially, whenever I got a wrong answer, I refreshed the page to avoid rewatching the corresponding video. Later, in a meeting, I learned that each quiz had a limit, and crossing it would lower my score. From that day, I stopped taking shortcuts and sincerely continued my course.

Lesson learned: “Move fast if you must, but never faster than your purpose.”

# Breakout Sessions
Breakout rooms gave us opportunities to discuss with peers. I experienced Unity in Diversity—we solved case studies, made new friends, and learned from each other, from small insights to deeper knowledge.

# First Breakout with Seniors
Himanshu P Dev, Ahana Sarkar, Pratheek G, Amruta Pattanaik, Shyam Patel, Divanshika Gupta, Divya Chhabra, Dnyanesh Agale, Jaisree Ragavi J guided us on what not to do to avoid losing HP (Health Points). Their advice: be consistent in whatever you do.

The activities made me realize that even small actions can create a greater impact.

# Reflections
I never imagined that in a 10-week journey, just 2.5 weeks would leave such a strong impact on me. Punctuality, discipline, and acknowledgment have already become part of my growth.

# Gratitude
I sincerely thank the organizers of this internship:

Sudarshan Iyengar Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar NPTEL

And the helping hands who guided us throughout:

Sakshi Sharma ma'am
Meenakshi V ma'am
Rohit Sharma sir
Jinal Gupta ma'am
Harshdeep R. ma'am 
Nitin Sankar sir

Special thanks to Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design ANNAM.AI for making this journey possible.

 Two weeks in, and the impact is already profound. The journey ahead looks even more promising.
