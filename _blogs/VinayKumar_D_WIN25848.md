Internships are often described as a bridge between theory and practice, and my experience with the NPTEL Internship truly lived up to that idea.
During this internship, I was introduced to the MERN stack, where I learned about MongoDB, Express.js, React, TypeScript, and Node.js. 
It is a powerful and widely used full-stack development framework. While I had some theoretical exposure earlier, 
this internship helped me understand how these technologies come together in real-world applications. 
At the beginning, the learning curve felt steep. Understanding how the frontend communicates with the backend, managing data, and structuring applications was challenging,
but it helped me strengthen my problem-solving and learning skills.
A major highlight of this internship was working on a case study and participating in breakout rooms. 
In the breakout rooms, everyone could ask their doubts and get them clarified through discussion. 
We also had stand-up sessions, where participants shared their experiences, learnings, and progress throughout the internship.
These sessions made the learning process more interactive and engaging.
