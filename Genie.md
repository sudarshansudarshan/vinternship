### **How to Start**

You'll get an invite link via email. Click it, sign in with your Google account, and you're in ViBe. Watch the videos, as they explain the topic to you. Download Zoho Cliq on your desktop, join the #Pinternship channel, enable Universal Access in settings, and upload a profile picture. You need a desktop or laptop, VS Code, and a stable internet connection. Keep your name and email consistent everywhere. Now start the first module.

### **The Three Phases**

Pinternship has three learning tracks. You progress through them at your own pace.

**Core Learning: ViBe Learning**

Watch all the ViBe videos on MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and TypeScript. Watch them thoroughly, take your time, and understand the concepts. Once you complete all the videos, Core Learning is finished, and you move to Advanced Learning.

**Advanced Learning: Case Studies**

Case studies are designed to help you understand the topics more deeply. Try to understand each case study first, and then attempt to code a solution for it. Getting stuck is normal, so do not panic. Ask questions on Cliq, revisit the videos, and discuss with others.

**Practical Learning: Projects**

After completing ViBe learning and case studies, you will contribute to real open-source projects that are actively transforming education. You will work with our developers, who will guide you in building real applications. Understand the feature requests, take them one at a time as challenges, and try adding new features to the respective projects.
