## **A Culture of Momentum: The Ejection Policy**

To maintain a high-energy environment, the program prioritizes **sustained effort** and active engagement over passive participation. We believe a learning community thrives when every participant contributes to the collective "pulse," which is why we employ a dynamic **Ejection Policy** to ensure the cohort remains focused. This system recognizes two distinct paths of movement:

**Forward Eject (The Ascent):** Super-performers who consistently stay at the top of the cohort and demonstrate **exceptional performance** are "ejected" upward into advanced leadership opportunities. These individuals may also be considered for prestigious **fellowship nominations** based on their demonstrated capability and reflective practice.

**Backward Eject (The Departure):** To preserve the quality of the experience and focus resources on committed learners, participants who remain persistently idle are removed from the cohort. This ensures that collaborative activities, such as **peer-to-peer viva sessions**, are conducted among interns who are equally invested in their growth.

**The Progress Algorithm**

We ensure transparency and fairness by using an automated, dual-criteria filter to identify idle participants. A **Backward Eject** is only triggered if an intern meets **both** of the following conditions simultaneously:

1\. **Daily Progress:** Your completion rate on the ViBe platform falls below **3.33% per day**.

2\. **Cohort Standing:** Your overall engagement level ranks within the **bottom 10% of the active cohort**.

By maintaining a pace above this threshold, you ensure your spot in the program remains secure while you build meaningful professional artifacts, including **case studies and reflective blogs**.
