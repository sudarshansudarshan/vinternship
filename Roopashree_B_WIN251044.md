Yes, I learned technical skills.

Yes, I explored frameworks and development concepts.

But what stayed with me the most were the invisible lessons:

Patience with myself
Respect for consistency
Courage to face problems instead of avoiding them
Comfort with not knowing everything immediately

These are lessons that go far beyond any single internship or technology stack.

Some days everything made sense. Components worked. APIs connected smoothly. Logic flowed naturally.
Other days, even simple problems felt heavy.

Grateful to be a part of the VLED Lab internship 

I really enjoyed learning the MERN stack and gaining hands-on experience with TypeScript and React. The stand-up meetings and breakout sessions made learning collaborative and engaging.

A valuable journey of learning and growth!
