Welcome to my Vinternship vlog! 🚀 In this video, I walk through the process of building my personal developer portfolio from scratch using the MERN stack (React, Express, Node) and TypeScript.

As a ECE student, I wanted a clean, type-safe way to showcase my full-stack journey and highlight some of my favorite recent builds. I also dive into the code to share why I chose TypeScript over plain JavaScript and how I tackled the learning curve of typing Express request and response objects.

A huge thank you to the VLED Lab and the @Vicharnashala community for creating this Call for Vlogs and encouraging us to share our authentic learning experiences!
