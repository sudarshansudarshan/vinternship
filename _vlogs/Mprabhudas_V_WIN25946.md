In this vlog, I share my experience of building a Food Delivery Frontend Application using React. This project helped me understand how real-world applications are structured using reusable components and dynamic rendering.

I explain how I implemented features such as restaurant listings, menu display, add-to-cart functionality, and responsive UI design using React concepts like components, props, state management, and event handling.

I also discuss the challenges I faced during layout design and state management, along with how I debugged and improved the user interface.

This video reflects my authentic learning journey as part of the Vinternship program.
